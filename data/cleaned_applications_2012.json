Also some traditions do not allow women to even have poverty registered in their names. This in turn limits their access to, education, information, communication, participatory, owner-women leadership democracy women status level, credit facilities due to take of collateral or security. It has been note that in many societies, material poverty interacts with gender based discriminations o that poor women's level of health, education and social participation are even lower than their male counterparts.The project will contribute to the carpe results, which need to provide and promote continuous professional development of gender equity education and training, man and women social leaders staff in order to adequately prepare them to facilitate the skills knowledge and attitudes required of secondary level students, not only for the demands of foster gender equity but also for their own further formation and self development.

The project will facilitate access to information, particularly development information and contribute to social consciousness and participation in decision-making. \n\nThe goal of the proposed project is to develop a living of standards life of community  to provide Information services to otherwise inaccessible communities within the Naogaon region. This innovative approach will provide a cost effective model for access to global knowledge resources and will facilitate the exchange of local knowledge, culture and experience.\n\n \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2        General objective\n\n \n\nThere are a growing number of models both in existence and in development that seek to bridge the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdigital divide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and engage marginal or excluded communities in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknowledge economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by using new technologies and specifically the Community Radio. This initiative aims to harness the potential of new technologies and find solutions through the following goals:\n\n \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Develop an appropriate access model for rural and geographically remote areas to obtain access to information\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Publish localised content that is specific to the community needs and provides an avenue for discussion and dialogue in native languages via the radio.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Reduce the feelings of isolation and promote interaction with the Naogaon community.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Enhance economic development and alleviate poverty through educational and economic opportunities. \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Identify new ways to generate wealth and provide new markets and distribution channels, reduce transaction costs and aggregate demand and buying power. \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Provide cheap and alternative methods of communication within and between communities.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2       Allow access to information and knowledge that can improve the lives and livelihoods of individuals and the community as a whole.\n\nDevelop a voice of Social entrepreneurship for social capital mobilization.\n\nActivity m: Microenterprise Development\n\nRural farmers cannot create and maintain livelihoods without access to affordable capital and markets. NHRD MicroFund program would provides micro grants and concomitant business development services to thirteen community-based organizations (CBOs) in northern part of Bangladesh whose members are engaged in agro-based micro enterprise activities, thus enhancing food security and reducing poverty.  The CBOs have created revolving loan funds, which can be tapped for investment in member-owned micro enterprises some of which include milk processing, fish and poultry farming, oil processing, vegetable gardening and goat-tending.  \n\nActivity n: Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG)\n\nIn the Bangladesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, thousands suffered near starvation following the collapse of the  agriculture sector in the 1954s.  Poor nutrition is still prevalent and particularly harmful to school-aged children in rural areas, resulting in low educational achievement and stunted growth. NHRDA will utilize Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG) technology whereby a small area of land is intensively cultivated using nature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own ingredients to rebuild and then maintain the soil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity.  Starting in 2013, NHRDA will began a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBIG Intensification Program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that has brought BIG technology, health and nutrition education directly into the classrooms and compounds of over 1156000 poor women, rural schools in the Naogaon district, thus reducing malnutrition and providing life-long agricultural skills to communities.\n\n\n\nDevelopment approaches of NHRDA and BR:\n\nFacilitate people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in need assessment, planning, and implementation of activities.\n\nAssist community organization for sustainability of development process, mobilization, and optimum utilization of local resources.\n\nDevelop and promote local voluntary activities through a group of volunteers.\n\nStimulate and encourage development of human potentials for self-improvement.\n\nInitiate, develop, and implement demonstrative projects; experiment innovative ideas; conduct action research.\n\nMediate and confer among donors, Govt. and other development organizations as a part of regular policy advocacy for desired social changes.\n\nDevelop strong organizational network for sharing experiences and obtaining services for sustainable development.\n\n\n\nImplementation Strategy:\n\nNHRDA implements different activities either by receiving supports Development Partner organization or in partnership with other organizations. Community participation, networking, linkage, membership, and gender sensitization are considered in the implementation process. NHRDA materializes its mission and vision encompassing components of a certain program or integrating different components of two or more programs. In case of intervention, program activities are carried out through field offices. NHRDA gives importance to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). BR will provide access to information for community.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship is the work of social entrepreneurs. A social entrepreneur recognizes a social problem and uses entrepreneurial principles to organize, create and manage a venture to achieve social change (a social venture). Whereas a business entrepreneur typically measures performance in profit and return, a social entrepreneur focuses on creating social capital. Thus, the main aim of social entrepreneurship is to further social and environmental goals. However, whilst social entrepreneurs are most commonly associated with the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors, this need not necessarily be incompatible with making a profit. Social entrepreneurship practiced with a world view or international context is called international social entrepreneurship. BR will provide this information to community people.\n\nEmpowerment Strategy\n\nWomen Victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associations and their motivating force: Door-to-Door Campaign against Trauma (DDCAT). The NHRDA works with the aim to completely rehabilitate victims of VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN and in doing so, they strongly believed that for full recovery, the victims in common area must band together to assist one another emotionally and economically as well as raise awareness about torture and human rights abuses in their own rural communities.  This is accomplished through Victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associations (VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and can therefore be thought of as a preventative measure as well as a curative one.  The idea of VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dawned on Mr. Akram Chowdhury after noticing how empowered and confident torture victims felt after treatment sessions that included the use of the Door to Door Campaign against Trauma (DDCAT). NHRDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Door to Door Campaign against Torture (DDCAT), a simple tool of human rights education for rural communities is a separate yet equally important preventive initiative run by the organization. The DDCAT is an extremely unique and effective means of spreading human rights awareness.  It is a slogan that combines elements of the constitution, the Convention against Torture, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Qur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122an and local laws to provide a message of how torture is prohibited by all these laws and what is the true responsibility of the police force.  The DDCAT is designed to be chanted at meetings and in public venues such as markets where it can be heard by all members of the community, even those who are illiterate.  The victims showed an interest to continue DDCAT back in their communities and the VA was born. BR will provide the DDCAT for community empowerment.\n\n\n\nActivity i: News Update\n\nNews on current local, national and international matters focusing on socio-economic, economic development, government decision, sports, cultural activism, local program agricultures promotion and market link etec will be telecast at regular interval in every day. Braking news update will bw broadcasted if important part of this news update.   \n\n    \n\nProject sustainability\n\n \n\nThe project will provide free access to a limited number of poor and marginalized target groups and communities. The extended network capabilities can subsidise operating costs by charging individuals, business, government and non government agencies for these services at a competitive rate. The project design will include the development of strategies to minimize ongoing costs such as equipment maintenance, connectivity and electricity charges.  Even when internet connectivity is not available the project design will also ensure a robust network that can provide localised emergency and health services, email. The planning and implementation draws heavily on the experience of staff and management from NHRDA.  Their commitment and guidance will ensure the project translates into appropriate outcomes relevant to the communities needs.\n\nSustainability:\n\nThis section looks at how Community Radio-for-rural-livelihood projects and programs can be set up in ways that continue to support livelihoods strategies in the longer term. This can be achieved by concentrating on: ownership, partnerships, involvement, capacity building, local innovations, and a cross-sectoral approach.\n\nCurrent knowledge base includes:\n\n\u00ef\u20ac\u00a0Multi-stakeholder partnerships and networks are recognized as important aspects of the enabling environment and can support community-driven initiatives.\n\nTo facilitate participatory, broadcasting-aware rural initiatives, it is recognized that a range of stakeholders need to work together. \u00ef\u20ac\u00a0Intermediaries should have a stake in the local community. BR interventions must build on existing systems, including information content (indigenous knowledge, local sources and databases), information technology (radio, telephone, internet), processes (existing surveys, research and extension), and policy environment. ICTs should be built into existing structures and should recognise the existing but less formal communication arenas.\n\n\u00ef\u20ac\u00a0In poorer countries, local community control and participation is widely recognized as critical to the success of ICT projects, such as tele-centers and application development. Community ownership works best when supported by well organized local institutions and where ICT demand emerges from community livelihood needs.\n\n\u00ef\u20ac\u00a0When an community radio project is cutting across sectors, it is likely to be more sustainable. Sustainable funding models require that the funding of a project must have clear objectives and an institutional framework.\n\n\u00ef\u20ac\u00a0The Mobile is a sustainable mobile communication service that has helped to create small business and provide connectivity to the rural areas. With the aid of microfinance loans, entrepreneurs can become Village Phone Operators, allowing them to buy the equipment they need to provide telecommunication services to villages.\n\nSustainable Livelihoods and Communication\n\nThe shift in development theory from modernization to dependency led to a rethinking of how communications can be harnessed for development. In the 1970s, multilateral organizations such as FAO began to implement two-way knowledge flows and information exchange between rural communities and technocrats, rather than one-way transfer of knowledge. This recognition that development comprises of more than just increased productivity led to alternative development approaches, such as the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) approach in the 1990s. The approach is centered on people and their livelihoods. It prioritizes people's tangible and intangible assets, and their ability to withstand shocks in the vulnerability context. It also prioritizes policies and institutions that reflect poor people's priorities, rather than those of the elite (Chambers and Conway 1991). Many multilateral, bilateral, and non-government agencies believe that using an SL approach is a sensible and practical way of thinking about planning and implementing development. Key elements of the approach have been used in a variety of development agencies ranging from bilaterals and multilaterals to international NGOs. \n\nSL approach as: \u00ef\u20ac\u00a0a more realistic understanding of poor people's livelihoods and the factors that shape them; \u00ef\u201a\u2022\u00ef\u20ac\u00a0building a policy and institutional environment that supports poor people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s livelihoods; and \u00ef\u20ac\u00a0supporting development that builds on the strengths of poor people and provides them ith opportunities to improve their livelihoods. The core principles underlying the approach are that poverty-focused development should be:\n\n1. People-centered. Sustainable poverty elimination will be achieved only if external\n\nsupport focuses on what matters to people, understands the differences between\n\ngroups of people and works with them in a way that is congruent with their current\n\nlivelihood strategies, social environment, and ability to adapt.\n\n2. Responsive and participatory. Poor people themselves must be key actors\n\nin identifying and addressing livelihood priorities. Outsiders need processes to listen\n\nand respond to the poor.\n\n3. Multi-level. Poverty elimination is an enormous challenge that can be overcome only\n\nby working at multiple levels, ensuring that micro-level activity informs\n\nthe development of policy and an effective enabling environment, and that macrolevel\n\nstructures and processes support people to build upon their own strengths.\n\n4. Conducted in partnership. With both the public and the private sectors;\n\n5. Sustainable. .There are four key dimensions to sustainability - economic, institutional, social and environmental sustainability. A holistic approach is essential with a balance between the different dimensions.\n\nAt the end of the project \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tA community radio station established and functioning;\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tMass awareness on health & nutrition, drinking safe water, proper sanitation, maintaining hygiene, primary immunization, family planning, maternity care, human rights, torture and violence against women and child, violence against tribal women, promoting local government activities launched by the government, promotion & development of local agriculture products, promotion and marketing linkage of handicraft produc, gengerequity, minority rights, labour rights, religious rights, womwn and child rights, and the child development through child club, community empowerment through DDCAT, 100% child education ensure through child club, child development centre, telecentre, radio program, farmers field university created among minimum the rural community living inNaogaon district.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tCommunity in Naogaon district empowered and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actively participated in community development.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\t There are also outputs identified in this proposal:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tA working model for a mobile multipurpose community telecentre.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tAn interconnected wireless community network.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tAn increase in social capital, skills and capacity.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tA localized information and knowledge sharing portal. \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tTo develop child leadership\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tTo develop women entrepreneurs\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tTo develop social entrepreneurs\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tTo develop victims Association (VA)  \n\n", "country_application": "", "country_application_name": "", "project_details_other": "\n--", "project_name": "Girls ang Young Women Empowerment through ICT and Community Radio", "country_impact_name": ""}, {"project_year": "2012", "country_impact": "KE", "project_id": "25", "sectors": [""], "project_details": "", "project_summary": "The projects aims to empower and transform domestic workers (Maids)  aged 18 to 30 years,to save and star an income generating activities in various areas of their choice to eradicate poverty and improve their standards of living Most of them are women working in estates with very little wages or none.They are  exploited and abused , this calls for attention from institutions to protect  them.", "country_application": "KE", "country_application_name": "Kenya", "project_details_other": "\nThe best outcome of economic viability and savings is more in women and girls.By and large the women by their nature are entrepreneurship and they create wealth so quickly ones they are established.

In rural areas men even do not call the name of their female family members before strangers. Women do not have any authority over the income of her husband. Beating women brutally is a common in rural areas of Balochistan. There are such areas where women do not have the right to eat meat. Meat is only male members of family. So urban areas are also affected with such cruel thinking and attitude. Beside rural areas, in urban areas we also witness the honor killing of women, throwing acid, rape and other incidents with innocent women.\n\nSo these worse conditions with women have compelled me to thank for the development and empowerment of women of Quetta Pakistan.\n1970-01-01 00:00:00", "project_name": "Women Skill Development Project", "country_impact_name": "Pakistan"}, {"project_year": "2012", "country_impact": "UG", "project_id": "40", "sectors": [""], "project_details": "", "project_summary": "With ten girls in each category, there are a total of 40 girls involved in the project.

How the family has molded me, from the first days of my preschool life, up to where i am right now. Looking mainly at how my own mother is hard working, and has been able to instill that hard work onto us has made me realize that the only person that can stop me from achieving my goals is me, and that what i can dream and believe in, i certainly can achieve. I also look at my own personal interactions in life, the people whom i look up to, and in turn, those who look up to me, and that alone makes me realize that i am who i am because of the relationships that i establish with other people, friends, relatives, and my girlfriend. As one with a strong moral and christian background, i also get my inspiration from how Jesus lived his life, so pure, so true,   giving us the moral lesson in life that i am my brother's keeper. That in itself always inspires me to dedicate all i do to the greater good of mankind, putting others first before i put my own interests. Lastly, one of my greatest inspirations has come from the work place environment. Being involved in an amazing organisation, which has team work and team motivation as key to its success. Also, working under an amazing, motivational and inspirational Executive Director who herself has been awarded an Ashoka Fellowship in recognition of her work in rural poverty alleviation clearly lives me in a position where i am inspired to emulate her work, and allow myself to follow in her footsteps. The first steps i have already started taking, as i was recently selected to be a Spark* Changemaker, pushing forward the concept of waste recycling and how it can be a game changer in developing communities and alleviating poverty. Changemakers are inspired, they believe that a challenge is in fact an opportunity to achieve great works. With the inspirational summit held in Johannesburg in May 2012, my mindset has clearly shifted, and i came out of the summit more than inspired and prepared to bring about change in the community, in the country, in Africa and beyond!\nFor many decades now, Africa has been largely doomed with the negative perception that women and girls in particular are meant to be regarded as 'second class citizens' in communities, especially the conservative rural communities. At the same time, most of these rural communities are characterized by high poverty rates owing to a lack of availability of resources from which an income can be derived. Being one person who has developed a keen interest in social entrepreneurship as an empowerment tool for rural poverty alleviation, i believe there is no other way to go but to focus primarily on women's groups and organisation as through the PEACE Foundation's experience with our project beneficiaries, women have that track record of making things happen in all of our cooperatives. This will in turn remove all the negative barriers on women empowerment in society and as i believe, will bring about that positive change in society. Apart from this, all the people who have positively played big roles in molding my life have been women, and hence, for me, women empowerment becomes something very personal and dear.

Discrimination reduces opportunities and incentives to acquire literacy learning among socially disadvantage groups. Literacy in Liberia is prominent among native born Liberians women and girls due to strong tradition, culture, and the unwholesome war that fought over 14 years. The lack of support for special needs further exacerbates lieteracy problems among these groups.  Adults whose mother tongue is different from the language or instruction tend to have lower literacy levels.

Women are not passive victims, we are contributing actively to peacemaking. Imagine what more we could do if we women were able to take an equal place at the negotiating table.'\n\nMen and women experience war differently. This 'gendering' of war is apparent with the widespread use of rape as a weapon. In Darfur, Sudan, for example, women of all ages have been raped or experienced sexual violence, with family members often forced to witness their humiliation and distress. Darfuri women risk rape and violence not only when fleeing their homes, but also in some cases when collecting firewood or water in and around refugee camps. It is an irony that these camps that exist to protect refugees often become sites of further violence.\n\nWomen, as mothers, wives, grandmothers and daughters bear most of the burden for social security within the household and community. Women and children also comprise the majority of the civilian casualties of war - they make up over 80 per cent of the world's refugees. Yet it is essential that women are not seen only as victims of war, but also as the decision-makers in peace-building.\n\n'The issue of equal participation by women is not simply an issue of gender equality and human rights but could represent the decisive factor in maintaining peaceful development in a troubled region,' says L.Seyoum from Eritrea.\n\nPromoting women's roles in leading community reconstruction is advocated by the United Nations in the Security Council Resolution 1325 which 'reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and peace-building and equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.'\n\nIn response to the current crisis in Darfur, the International Women's Development Agency is seeking to help the wider development community to integrate gender considerations into emergency operations. Areas that have been addressed to date are firewood and fuel collection; the psychological effects of gender based violence, and reproductive health. These gender considerations can be found on the IWDA website and can be used freely. Any feedback is welcome.\n\nUnfortunately, the issue of conflict and reconstruction look set to increase over the next decade. Let's hope we can use our skills, knowledge and technological advances to assist women and their families maximize their roles as peace-builders in the reconstruction of their communities.\n\n\nThe Convention On The Elimination Of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women is an important tool for addressing the human rights of rural  women as well as elimination of discrimination they face  throughout their lifespan. women will express their concerns about the lack of statistical data disaggregated by sex, abuse, neglect, violence against rural women and insecurity in financial, medical and housing needs including exclusion from national ID network, which cumulatively expose them to multiple forms of discrimination. \nThere are so many legislations and practices in different countries that discriminate against rural women. For example many rural women from rural areas and minority communities in south Sudan do not have access to ID cards and any allowances that are provided by the Government. It is therefore imperative that States Parties review legislation and practice through both a gender related perspective and take appropriate action.\n\n\n\n Governments should collect statistical data disaggregated by sex and age on the situation of rural  women illiteracy, with indicators on poverty, illiteracy, violence against women, health and housing related issues including care givers for  HIV/AIDS, migrant/retuness women, rural women, women living in areas of conflict and  women belonging to minorities, and disabled women.\n\n\n\n\n\n Negative stereotyping of rural women and traditional harmful practices can be manifested in various forms of rural women abuse and violence. Governments should encourage the media to correct negative attitudes towards rural women and project positive images of rural  women regarding their contribution to their families and society as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRural  women are often discriminated against in terms of participation in public and political positions as well as decision-making positions. Age specific public policies could open opportunities for rural women to participate fully and effectively in the political, economic and social spheres of their societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe illiteracy rates amongst rural women are often high especially in rural areas. This illiteracy level is compounded by gender discrimination which seriously limits rural women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to information on their rights and their ability to participate in development and community activities. Access to vocational adult education or basic literacy and life skills training are very important to protect their rights as well as ensure access to the basic services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany rural women illiteracy  face discrimination in the work place and are compelled to work in low paid or part time jobs without income security. Very few rural illiteracy women have access to pensions.  Retirement ages also may differ between men and women.  Many rural women due to care giving responsibilities in the family bear the financial penalty of low pensions because of their absence in the labour market. They also bear the physical and emotional cost of stress from balancing work and care giving obligations. States Parties need to take appropriate measures to address these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to affordable or free health care services is very important for older women in order to enjoy a satisfactory standard of mental and physical health. Post menopausal difficulties and diseases, neglect in disability and absence of geriatric medicine requires special attention. States Parties should adopt a comprehensive health policy.\n\n\n\nThe feminization of poverty is very common among rural  women due to unequal access to credit and labour markets, unequal remuneration and unremunerated work at home. Governments should provide special support systems and collateral-free micro credit as well as encourage micro entrepreneurship for rural women.\n\n\n\n\n\n Special programmes should be tailored to address the physical, mental, emotional, and health needs of rural women in rural areas with special focus on women belonging to minorities, migrant/retuness women, women living in areas of conflict and women with disabilities.\n\n\n\n In many countries the state of widowhood or being single due to divorce or never having been married profoundly changes rural women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status in society and can result in discrimination both in law and in practice, particularly in terms of property and inheritance rights. Women from minority group suffer more due to above difficulties.\n\n\n\n", "project_name": "Women leading change", "country_impact_name": "Sudan"}, {"project_year": "2012", "country_impact": "IQ", "project_id": "90", "sectors": [""], "project_details": "", "project_summary": "Due to abounded wars over the Iraq and left a negative impact of many where women were first assumed these effects either Pfqdha the death of her husband and make the widow of the responsibility of living as well as to raise their children or suffer from displacement and which from the scourge of poor economic situation and in that most of the displaced families and displaced and Alvakadi National", "country_application": "IQ", "country_application_name": "Iraq", "project_details_other": "\nTo develop the potential of women in vocational training\n\n", "project_name": "Conduct Hairdressing Training for women ", "country_impact_name": "Iraq"}, {"project_year": "2012", "country_impact": "MW", "project_id": "91", "sectors": [""], "project_details": "", "project_summary": "The Oilproject is expected to benefit 1000 women and girls including 128 women of the Golomoti Active AIDS Support Organization (GASO) support group of women living with HIV and AIDS.

They are very much neglected in the family and have problem of surviving. If they want do some income generation activity, they have no capital. Due to poor condition, the banks also do not provide credit._x000D_\nThe major cause for such a situation is that all the women in the villages are primarily dependent upon their husband/father and on rain fed agriculture for their sustenance. There is no irrigation facility in villages of Igbepa,sagamu,iwelepe,atoyo,ibelefun,ogijo,agele,makun,offin,ajegunle$iwade 60% women and girls are illiterate. The agriculture has now become uncertain because of climate change & untimely rainfall. This ultimately leads them to sit idle or to migrate to distant places in search of livelihoods as labor or maid servant, where they get further exploited. _x000D_\nGirls on the other hand are allowed to study till primary level and get drop out after it. It is because; the government primary schools are in the villages only up to primary 5. The high schools are only 3 to 4 in number in a block (amongst 20 to 30 villages) and situated about 3 to 5 kilometers from the village headquarter. High school education is costly because of costlier books and some fee in the school. Poor parents hence do not send their girls to high school. _x000D_\nThere is also no public transport in the villages most are pitch roads. Igbepa, sagamu, iwelepe, atoyo, ibelefun, ogijo, agele, makun, offin, ajegunle$iwade is full of forests and hills. Hence parents do not allow their daughters to go far on foot due to fear of rape and order situation. When they pass primary 5, they become adolescent and are married thereafter by the age of 14-16 years. The major cause for this is lack of money and a narrow attitude of parents towards girls. All the girls who are withdrawn from schools are made to work at their respective houses in cooking food; looking after kids and doing other house hold work. It is other way of child labor in her own house. Finally they are married at a very early age for which they are neither prepared physically nor psychologically. _x000D_\nTherefore xenal enterprises support the single women and unemployed young women with credit (income generation activities). The amount given is. #25,000 to #100,000 by which they can enhance their income through goatary, poultry, piggery, grocery shop, tea-stall etc in which the women are competent enough to run their business themselves with little a training. The amount repaid was given as loan to other poor women for some business. Thus it goes on revolving and benefiting more and more women for years and years._x000D_\nThe micro-credit loan was at 1% interest rate (called service charge). Thus by advancing a loan of us with a grant of $25,000 (800 to 1000) women would get livelihoods, reducing their poverty. And more villages will benefit from the micro credit empowerment the service charge obtained was using used to pay the salary of the single staff involved in micro-credit program._x000D_\nThe rest 50% of the service charge is used to sponsor adolescent girls at the rate of. #9,000 to one girl for school fee, books-copy-pen, dress etc per term.

In my country, I have seen many women, who are very intelligent, but did not have a chance to go to college. They end up working hard, but earn much less than men do. The reason is due to persistent patriarchal norms at the village level, which have been virtually excluded women from high return jobs. Further, due to the persistence of patriarchal values, men are always respected and women are disregarded. As such, parents always choose to send their sons, instead of daughters, to school for higher education. Many women have to give up their dreams, stay at home or get married at a very early age. I have a strong belief that the best way to help them to pursue higher education and build a better life in the society is to help them become more economically independent. Through entrepreneurship, women will have opportunities to connect with wider social and economic systems in the region and as a result, they can build up their communicating, marketing and negotiating skills, an experience that they have never gone through themselves.

Although I am not a technology buff, Steve Job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taught me three things that has been so indispensable when it comes to development work and empowering rural women._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFirst, a new idea tends to face resistance because people think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsince it has not been done before, why do you think it will work?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. NDI faced resistance from many people when we first introduced the idea of Project Light. Some asked why we must get rural women to pay for the lamps. Others say silly things like they will run away with the items and we will not be able to find them .Some said that only established and resource-rich groups can get such projects off the ground. I learnt to ignore such comments and push ahead, because even if I fail, the process of failing provides fertile ground to learn and create a more robust system. We did indeed encountered some failures in the process but turns out, the key learning point was not failing, but how well you adapt and rescue the process from irreversible failure. In short, as beautifully put by The New Yorker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Atul Gawande, its not about failure, but about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mastery of rescue\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSecond, always place values at the forefront of your mission and work and do not compromise even as the organization grows. For Apple, Job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has always been to design and create beautiful products first, with the profit motive coming in second. The decline of Apple in the 90s occurred when Apple placed the profit motive first and great products second. I have always believed that for NDI to grow and make a greater impact, we need to maintain the purity of our values and mission. There have been instances where well -meaning people had asked us to increase the price of the solar lamps so that we can be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinancially sustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 faster. This approach will give us a short term profit gain but in the long run, compromise our ability to reach out to more rural people who do not have much disposable income._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThird, I learnt the importance of passion. Jobs once said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You need a lot of passion for what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing because it is so hard. Without passion, any rational person would give up.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The work we do is difficult, consume a lot of time and may not be appreciated. During rational moments, you may ask yourself, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy am I am doing this?
