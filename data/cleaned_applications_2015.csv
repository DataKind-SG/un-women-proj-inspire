METHODOLOGY_x000D_
Establishment of Village Solar charging stations_x000D_
We shall set up solar charging stations to be run by local women groups. The stations provide solar lamps and phone charging services. The women undertake this as a group enterprise on a rent-to-own model by renting out the lamps daily at a cost lower than kerosene. After 4 to 6 months, the individual households   own a solar lamp and an improved  cook stove. _x000D_
We mainly deal with the award winning Green Light planet products- sun king lamps and also partner with The Energy Resource Institute (TERI) under the Lighting a Billion lives programme for supply of the fixed charging station model. These are LED solar lamps that charge for a duration of six hours and are also able to charge even during cloudy days. They all have a two years warranty_x000D_
_x000D_
Capacity building trainings on entrepreneurship and leadership skills_x000D_
The main objective is to provide the women with entrepreneurial skills that will ensure sound management of the Green Energy enterprises such as the solar charging station. The trainings are facilitated in collaboration with professional trainers from institutions such as Kenya Institute of Management (KIM), Ministry of Industrialization and Economic Projects Trust Fund (EPTF). The training strategy adopts a participatory approach as well as videos and site visits to existing businesses run by women in the region._x000D_
To identify the problems and undertaking a needs assessment, we have been able to organize focused group discussions with various women groups hence the selection of the proposed training areas including;_x000D_
- Entrepreneurship (Basic concepts)_x000D_
- Business Communication skills & fundamentals of customer service_x000D_
- Financial Literacy (Accounting for small enterprises)_x000D_
- Marketing Skills_x000D_
- Group Savings and Loaning_x000D_
Community Sensitization_x000D_
_x000D_
We will also undertake community outreaches to create awareness on the importance of using clean energy and the negative effects of traditional energy sources to them and to the environment. This is done through giving talks, drama and puppetry at community groups, markets, schools, beaches among and other social avenues._x000D_
","By the end of January 2016, we aim to have enabled 300 households become smokeless by owning a solar lamp and an improved cook stove through a rent to own model. About 1800 people including the youth, children and men will benefit from these clean energy sources indirectly. It is then expected that 250 new smokeless homes will always be created after every 6months from the repayments made to the solar charging stations, hence more people benefiting indirectly through education, reduced respiratory illnesses, reduced risk to open fire accident in the households among others.","In Kenya, 82 % of the total population is still not connected to modern electricity, with the majority being in the rural and peri urban areas. These populations also earn less than $3 per day and spend up to 50% of this income on energy for basic household lighting and cooking needs hence lack of enough disposable income. They use of traditional energy sources such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene emits toxic pollutants, which causes respiratory illnesses leading to premature deaths especially among women and children. Every year 2 million people globally die out of indoor air pollution. 44% of them are children and 60% of adults are women. Moreover, women and girls in the rural areas make an average of 2 to 3 trips per day in search for fuel wood hence lack of enough time for productivity, fire accidents at households’ level as a result of using open fires and the school going children are also disadvantaged from studying during the extra curricula hours in the evening.EW"

By September 2016 we expect to have rolled out the app to at least 600 test users._x000D_
By December 2016 we expect to be ready to deploy the fully functioning app to the whole Wedu community.","Young women in high school and university struggle to complete their studies and gain a better life afterward also due to the lack of access to information (i.e. source of funding, learning resources, internship opportunities etc) and lack of a network of supporters to help them in the moment of difficulty. This is particularly true for first generation students and those coming from rural areas.

Wedu provides access to critical financing to complete studies and information on how to address the most common challenges of students. We deliver an online leadership training focused on soft skills critical to increase employability.



Most importantly, we are creating a network of women, called Rising Stars, and mentors, both men and women, from all over the world that support  Rising Stars sharing experiences and other resources. So far none of the girls in our program has ever dropped out of school. This remarkable achievement is the result of quality of the community we are nurturing.1K"

Matched with a mentor (a local University student) and connected to this network of helpful peers, 150 left-behind children in Guizhou will gain practical entrepreneurship and ICT skills that can empower their learning in Math and English. They will also be equipped with soft skills and training to create culture-sensitive curriculum for their juniors. This will be done via 10D long summer-and-winter bootcamp programmes that are coordinated with a blended learning pedagogy in which interaction for the rest of the year will be web-based. Effectively, these 5 villages will be adopted and Code4GUIZHOU will build trust, social capital and community assets so that lasting change is created through returning engagements._x000D_
By putting girls into SWAT teams for change, market opportunities will be identified and rapidly tested. At the end of our pilot, the associated students and villagers would have launched a crowdfunding campaign to provide ongoing capacity-building support and garnered seed capital for local enterprises. At the end of 3 years, it is hoped that at least 1 viable and economically self-sufficient market opportunity has been unleashed and operating smoothly in each of these villages to create employment opportunities for locals._x000D_

Alongside training such left-behind children, consultations and check-ins will also be implemented with village elders, parents and teachers to build an ecosystem of support for these children. This serves to align stakeholders’ interests.  _x000D_

Our tech education programme therefore aims to create self-starters, auto-didacts who knows how to show up, take action and make plans, supported by a network of local and overseas contacts that acts as their bridge to bigger dreams. Through our team-based, gamified pedagogy, we want to build confidence and impart practical skills for these girls to eventually take learning and community organizing into their own hands. Not everyone needs a college degree. But poverty often comes with its own set of self-limiting beliefs and ways of thinking about the world that makes it hard for these girls to find their own paths, we believe that cross-functional modules in communication, problem-solving, leadership, design and programming will prepare these girls for success._x000D_
_x000D_
Code4GUIZHOU invites girls to think of their life as a canvas; given their limited resources and extended reach made possible by technology – what opportunities would they pursue? How would they turn every engagement/connection into a minimal experiment? We believe that our personal experiences as high school dropouts turned college graduate turned tech entrepreneur allow us to be more empathetic and engaging with our approach.","By July 2015 we aim to educate 150 girls with our training program. We expect a third of them to go on to pursue further education or be engaged in employment or entrepreneurship eventually.By December 2016, these girls would have launched a crowdfunding campaign to fundraise for ongoing training support (for the next 2 years) and seed capital for local enterprises. They would have also marketed their villages online, increasing tourist flow by 200%, attracting a viewership of 50,000 unique views+follows on WeChat, Sina Weibo and their web portal._x000D_
At the end of 3 years, at least 1 viable and economically self-sufficient market opportunity has been unleashed and operating smoothly in each of these villages to create employment opportunities for locals, bringing 50 parents back in total.","With a PPP per capita of $7,292, educational attainment suffers from the lack of access to key resources, good teachers and context-sensitive material; access to computers and the internet goes without saying. Many girls find themselves quitting school in order to start generating income for the family, which plunges them further in the poverty cycle since they have limited capacity to obtain marketable skills.

Then there are the associated psychological stresses that come from being left behind and being poor in general. The social isolation and sense of shame that comes from being poor often leaves these children lacking in confidence and “showing up” for networking and exposure, and this absence of social capital and experience puts them at a severe disadvantage when they eventually come out to work. In summary the challenge is to provide locally meaningful education – education that opens the door to employment and other assorted technologies.1W"
2015,389,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,,Women Green Entrepreneurships ,Save the Environment (SE),Pakistan,Pakistan,0,,['Environment & Sustainability'],"The project “women green entrepreneurships” is proposed to setup and sustain the women environmental enterprises in Miandam valley district Swat, Pakistan. The project will be implemented in 10th months with the technical assistance of “Save the Environment, Pakistan”. 11 villages of Miandam valley is consist of 425 households with estimated 3400 population (women: 1800) will be the target households to benefit from this project. In this project, 90 households will directly participate as beneficiaries and outreach activists for women economic empowerment. _x000D_
Miandam valley is a hotspot of natural resources and almost 70% (of 425 households) people are dependent on wild plants including medicinal, aromatic, sheltering and agricultural plants, for their livelihood generation. The wild plants include herbs, shrubs and few species of trees. The habitat of these plants exists in the natural plain areas, hilly and sloppy terrains and the narrow gullies in the hillocks. According to the local farmers and women; the wild plants are used in abundance to produce natural medicines for the health remedies, fragrance and antiseptic. The elders, women and hakims are the expert groups on plants collection, habitat’ identification, processing and products marketability. They also carry extraordinary indigenous knowledge about the valuable plants and earn good incomes through recommending for natural health medication. _x000D_
_x000D_
Out of 70% people, 80%-85% are the women who are directly or indirectly involve in generating daily incomes. According to the assessment of Project team, 25%-30% women are running environmental enterprises; they collect wild plants and sell in local community and market with poor prices which could not fulfill the daily basic needs of the family. Project team has confirmed that majority of the women are the conflict affectees and lost their bread earners and subject to food insecurities. Because of the women poor skills of collection, they are blamed for so many reasons, tortured and prohibited from collecting the wild plants and wildlife species. They have poor skills of processing, labeling, marketing and channelizing markets. Their daily earning is recorded as 3-5 USD. _x000D_
_x000D_
All these women environmental enterprises are subject to vulnerabilities because the vegetation of medicinal and aromatic plants has been significantly declined. It is due to the fact that the wild plants are uprooted improperly during the collection. Women are not aware on certain significant plants-livelihoods generating value chains and their improper practices negatively affect the natural base. _x000D_
This project is planned to develop 14 women green enterprises and sustain the livelihoods generation from the natural resources. 14 enterprises from 425 houses will be chosen with the consensus of households and farming elders. They will be trained in green entrepreneurship concepts of collection, processing and marketability. They will have all information on wild plants, value chains and market channels. They will be enabled to develop home based nurseries of such plants to regularly obtain raw materials for producing products. They will be connected through an enterprises network which will exchange information and fix product values and facilitate new enterprises development for women sustainable income generation. _x000D_

The proposed program activity will involve 3 media tools, radio, social media and video. How? Culturally, women are to be seen and not heard and such circumstances are rooted deep within our institutions and systems especially in Africa and Asia. The traditional ‘baraza’ where only men were involved on the negotiation table when it came to discussing community issues is still very prevalent in our societies today. Is the woman ready to speak? Honestly, she is not really even asking to be heard. To be honest, she is afraid. She is afraid to speak up and be called a rebel. She is afraid to stand out. She is afraid to embarrass her husband or family. In fact, she does not even think she has the potential or power to bring about change, when in reality- she absolutely does. This mind set must change!We have to start speaking to our daughters. We have to encourage them to use their voices, and use them wisely. Young women need to notice the issues in their community and spear head coming up with creative solutions. How? We encourage young women and women in general to use media tools and communicate._x000D_
Most people are unaware that majority of farmers in Africa are women. Also research shows that if you invest in a woman she will invest in her community.  When access to water is a gender issue because it will be the mother and her daughter walking for hours to fetch water for the household: It will be the daughter who will be asked to quit school to be able to support her sibling who is male, She could be married off to pay debt as well.  With all these realistic situations- when it comes to solvable solutions, the woman’s voice is barely heard in the negotiation table. _x000D_
Most people lack information or access to adequate information. Issues discussed on radio/video/ social media will revolve around conflict resolution techniques- actual community techniques to deal with pressing issues within the community. Young girls in these areas struggle to communicate with elders on matters from discussing affordability of sanitary pads, or creative alternative solutions, domestic violence, unemployment challenges, inaccessibility to education etc.  By practicing and encouraging verbal communication skills, learning conflict resolution techniques and group leadership skills the girls will have the opportunity to make changes in their lives and the lives of their community. Not only communicate- but this will also be accessible information for others to replicate or custom to their community through new applications such as whatsapp._x000D_
Media training- We encourage young women to utilize the camera.  We will train and improve their writing skills through advocacy and writing training to improve their social media skills through blogging and marketing of their blog. Their editing and photography skills to communicate and expand upon those ideas discussed more briefly on the radio program ensuring issues addressed, techniques to facilitate dialogue between community elders, leaders and the youth are necessary._x000D_

The results show that maternal mortality is still unacceptably high and is the second largest cause of female death. The main direct causes of maternal mortality are pregnancy-related complications, most of which occur on the day of birth or shortly afterwards, with bleeding, infections and unsafe abortions being the main indirect causes.  In a report by the Ministry of Health, 16,182 girls and young women had an abortion in 2011 against 10,785 in 2010 and 8,717 in 2009. Unsafe abortion accounts for 15 per cent of maternal deaths in Ghana, and also accounted for 25 to 30 per cent of maternal deaths in leading teaching hospitals in the country. It is impeding the country’s efforts at achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 which is primarily aimed at reducing maternal mortality by 75 per cent by 2015.

The communities at the lakes are mainly dominated by youth who depend on fishing for their income and food security.  It is uncommon to find women in these communities at sea fishing due to the laborious nature of the work involved and the associated risks. Therefore most women resort to hiring men to go out to sea to catch fish for sell on their behalf while others engage in micro businesses like fish mongering,  smoking and frying. Moreover, the number of unemployed women in fishing communities is alarmingly high because they are characterised  by; low levels of education where a few of them complete primary school and fewer transition to secondary school , teenage pregnancy, lack of skills, remoteness, marginalisation from government development initiatives and lack of infrastructure.100 young women living along the shores of Lake Victoria and the nearby islands in Jinja district will be trained on how they can use lake based cages to successfully rear fish for income generation.  The training will equip the women on setting up of fish cages, hatching fish, feeding them, treating them, making fish feeds and joint marketing to achieve economies of scale in the fishing business. The project will set up 10 demonstration cages which will be used by the women to practice fish cage rearing for one cycle, which takes 8 to 12 months for the fish to mature for sale. After every cycle, a new batch of young women will be recruited for training and supported to practice lake based fish cage farming using the same demonstration cages while those who will have been weaned off will be ready to create their own fish cages, hence creating a multiplier effect._x000D_
Water bodies in Uganda are plagued with destructive fishing methods, over fishing, and environmental degradation which threatens marine life and consequently has forced the government of Uganda to put stringent restrictions to fishing activities in water bodies._x000D_
Lake based cages as a technology requires less labour, takes less money and the technology is easily replicable. The technology also enables one to rear comparatively more fish and the quality of the yields is better because the fresh water of the lake is a natural habitat for the fish, providing good quality abundant water. An example of what Ugandan shillings 5 million (about USD 1500) can do compared to putting the same amount in ponds or tanks;_x000D_
You can raise a cage of 1,025 cubic metres, which will accommodate atleast 5,000 fish, yielding 105,050 kilos. Using the same Shs5m for a pond, it will give you a pond of 600 cubic metres, which will hold about 1,800 fish. If you devote the Shs 5m to tanks, it will give you three tanks of the type that can hold 900 fish each, giving you a total of 2,700 fish. _x000D_
","By December 2016, 100 young women aged 18 to 25 years living in fishing communities in Jinja district; Uganda will be skilled in lake based fish cage farming. It is expected that after a 12 months cycle of practicing fish cage farming in the demonstration cages, they will be well equipped  to set up lake cages for fish farming cages.",the project will address the problem of unemployment for out of school young women aged 18 to 24  living in fishing villages in Eastern Uganda  through skills building on lake based fish farming technology.  1•

The project will target two universal secondary schools where a total of 200 girls aged 13 to 15 years will directly be engaged in the project activities.  Tablets will be availed to the girls who will be mentored to use them as learning tools to gain knowledge and skills during the project implementation course, expected to take 1 year. Within this period the girls will undergo an ICT based-micro business skills training that will be highly self-explorative. Tasks will be guided by their teachers and business mentors who are local entrepreneurs.  The girls will be supported to conduct an individual reflection of the micro businesses they can do from home to find out the businesses they can comfortably do. Using this information, the girls will be supported to form small business teams of 10 girls and come up with business ideas which they will develop further into micro enterprise business plans that integrate ICT usage. For this reason, they will be introduced to online technological tools to use in accessing information essential for designing their business plans (e.g google, you tube, free software). The teams will peer review the business plans through to exchange opinions for improving them. At that point, each group will be introduced to a line business mentor who will guide them through the process of improving their plans (obtaining product information, marketing, prices etc).   School level competitions will be organised where the business teams will be provided with a platform to showcase their business ideas and seed capital worth Ugandan shillings 1,000,000/- per school will be divided among the business teams to experiment and share feedback on their project. Many young girls living in poverty, in search for a better living are highly prone to risks like teenage pregnancy, early marriage and HIV and AIDs which lead to schools drop outs. According to the Uganda Demographic survey 2011, only 4% of Uganda’s females complete secondary school. Teenage pregnancy and motherhood has remained a major social concern in Uganda closely linked to school dropout moreover the current school policy in Uganda is to have pregnant girls terminate their education.  Secondary school going girls from poor households in Uganda majorly access education through universal secondary schools. Unfortunately the government of Uganda can only afford to pay the schools an annual grant of up to UShs 141,000 ($52) per student, spread over three school terms annually. This means that the students and their households have to bear the burden of providing for their other needs such as uniforms, stationery and meals.  Skilling the poor girls in home based micro businesses will help them generate supplementary income that help them address some of their basic needs to complement what their caregivers are able to provide them_x000D_

We are teaching basic digital literacy to 14 high school girls to increase their chances on continuing their education and increase their chances of getting employed or starting an entrepreneurship venture. We chose Rifat Anwer's center in Gujranwala for this project. Rifat is a community leader and education activist who runs a community center where 200 children, mostly girls receive education. We plan to replicate this project throughout Pakistan. We plan to train 20 community leaders and social entrepreneurs so that they can start their own social enterprises which can sustain their work and at the same time, promote entrepreneurship in their region. Our flagship trainings include digital literacy and coding trainings along with social entrepreneurship. After the master training, we will pair our 20 digital leaders with two mentors, one for entrepreneurship advice and the other for technical training and content. We are also working on our online learning platform to provide a uniform learning platform to all our centers across the country. We will support our trained community leaders with training support, mentors and inspirational talks from our hand picked female tech leaders from around the globe. In the next phase, we will select 5 most promising digital leaders from our master class and upgrade their centers to innovation hubs in their regions. We will provide them with equipment, technical and other support to take their centers to the next level for empowering the women and girls in their communities._x000D_

","In 3 months time, 14 school girls in one center learned how to use Office software, make their CVs, and got introduced to different online learning platforms and MOOC courses. We are now preparing to introduce those girls to a more advanced course; Coding. We are also signing up new students for the basic course. In a year's time, one center would have trained 60 or more students who can find and apply for jobs or pursue different training courses online or start a small business. By the end of the year, we plan to launch our master training program, to empower 20 community leaders to host their own digital literacy, coding and social entrepreneurship trainings. In a year's time, these 20 community leaders can each train 60 more women in their respective centers in different regions of Pakistan. By December 2016, we will have 1200 young women trained so that they can explore different career trajectories either in the ICT/IT sector or become entrepreneurs. ","There is a huge demand of ICT related trainings for educated women and girls for access to job market and educational opportunities in Pakistan. Educated girls cannot access job market because they lack digital skills to apply for jobs and look for information. Due to cultural and social norms, females are barred from cybercafes which are traditionally frequented by males.

During the last decade, wearing Lamba landy was not famous within young Malagasy people and craft women using this raw material became unemployed and poor. Due to the socio-economic and political crisis on 2009, they had no jobs because most of them are illiteracy and are inexperienced for to find jobs in town. Also, they revitalize this traditional textile by producing in regional level with the support of EDENA NGO for to reach the required quality and level of professionalism in order to access market and give a sustainable and profitable business for disadvantage women and girls. Also, our project aim is to enhance the employment field for disadvantaged women of Kelifaritra Ambohidrabiby and Arivonimamo by improving “lamba landy” into fashion design which addresses actual costumers. Our specific objectives are to•	Modernize the materials and equipments of these women: this objective is important because it motivates them to be concentrated in this activity and increase the quantity and quality of the raw materials and their production. _x000D_
•	Enhancing their capacity and knowledge on this job. This is very important because actually, customers are more exigent in term of quality and creativity. Consequently, these women need to follow this tendency in order to sustain the project._x000D_
•	Access to market is a big problem because actually in National level, this activity is dominated by rich people and foreigner. Providing these women the capacity to reach market in National and International level is a one way to maintain this activity durably and profitably. _x000D_
To attend it, we will supply them with: _x000D_
1.	Materials and equipment_x000D_
•	Plantation of 200 tapia and 200 mulberry trees: due to the actual degradation of forest from bush fire and charcoal, the natural habitat of the silk moth is destroyed and cocoons become rare and very expensive. Also, the raw materials are not sufficient to produce enough silk for reaching market demand. With this Project Inspire program, we will Increase the quantity of this raw materials by planting these tree species which constituted the food of silkworm in Arivonimamo villages_x000D_
•	Supply them 10 modern looms: most of actual looms are heritages from their grandmother and is not able to give a textile more than 3 m. However, some customer demand and some fashion design require longer. With this modern looms, these women can produce of about 10 m. _x000D_
•	Buy 5 sewing machines: actually, these women still producing a silk textile for the traditional burial shrouds, for covering dyed and producing women shawls because they do not have sewing machine to transform it into fashion design and accessories. However, these products can be more profitable than the actual products and can improve their income._x000D_

•	Developing the capacity of 20 vulnerable women of Arivonimamo during 1 month on how to plant and maintain the cherry and tapia seedlings, they will benefit also a capacity building on how to rear silk moth and producing enough cocoon in order to satisfy market demand._x000D_
•	Training during 1 month of 20 disadvantage womne on modern looms: despite that these women know how to weave, the patterns in the textile still traditional and do not follow the actual design. With the modern looms and training, they will be able to produce more patterns according the needs of market and can customize the silk tissue according the need of customers._x000D_
•	Training during 6 months of 10 unscholar girls on sewing and fashion design: with this training, they will be able to turn the Malagasy silk textile into fashion and interesting accessories as pocket, shoes, hat…This will help them to promote their business and diversify their product for potential customers both internationally and Nationally. _x000D_
•	Training during 3 months of vulnerable 60 women and girls on entrepreneurship and business: with these training, we will help them to manage their business in order to grow into small scale entrepreneurs. As their product is from pure silk, we would like to promote it through a label bio-textile which is in vogue actually, enabling them to connect to market demand. _x000D_
3.	Access to market_x000D_
•	Establish showroom: as these women have no fund and are poor, they cannot exhibit their product permanently with their own effort. Also, the customers cannot see, appreciate and buy this Malagasy textile. Consequently, their income diminishes and they cannot focus on this job which could bring valuable revenue for their families._x000D_
•	Creation of website: this is important to attract International market because few Malagasy craftsmen have this opportunity. Establishing website will enable them to show their products in the network and sell it online. _x000D_

Most of women and their children leave their region and increase the number of homeless people in town and begging on the streets. In addition, deforestation increases the desertification.

In view of its increasing use and demand, ICT was introduced into the school curriculum as a subject which is examinable by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) at the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) level in Ghana to enhance teaching and learning as part of the millennium development goals (MDGs) outlined by the United Nations (UN) years ago. _x000D_
However, ICT education still remains a challenge, especially in the Northern part of Ghana and mostly at the basic schools level due to lack of ICT resource centres, inadequate text books and lack of professionally trained and competent ICT teachers in most basic schools. Hence students complete the academic calendar learning about the computer as a major ICT tool but never get to use the physical computer in any of their lessons. Girls are the most affected because in the patriarchal society of Northern Ghana, education of boys is often prioritized over girls, who are usually consigned to performing household chores. This inhibits rural girls’ access to computers and other ICT facilities._x000D_
Hence the project dubbed “ICT 4 GIRLS” seeks to equip basic school girls in Sagnarigu District and Tamale Metropolitan Assembly with ICT knowledge and skills for their examination and progression into higher levels of learning and to build their capacities in this area to enable them use ICT tools to advocate for their rights and opportunities including their rights to education and ICT facilities. It is also meant to prepare basic school girls for entrepreneurial and employment opportunities when implemented._x000D_
Project Aims and Objectives_x000D_
1.	Provide school girls with access to conducive and girl friendly ICT learning facilities. _x000D_
2.	Build the delivery capacity of ICT teachers _x000D_

","Nyanga, a sprawling, poverty-stricken illustration of Cape Town’s urban sprawl, is one of the oldest and largest black townships after Langa, establishing itself as early as 1955. It lies about 26 kilometres from the city centre, along the N2 close to the Cape Town International Airport and, like most of townships in the country, originated as a result of the migrant labour system - a spill over once Langa was filled to capacity. Nyanga became notorious for its black on black faction fighting that was allegedly perpetrated by police in the early eighties. The local authorities (izibonda) grouped themselves according to their background and used that as their criteria when allocating land. These cultural differences were allegedly used by the police to stir up violence, and elements of the community were infiltrated by the apartheid regime. This led to emergence of the notoriously violent group called 'the witdoeke' (the white scarfs). As a result of these fights Tambo square was formePN"

Background:_x000D_
In Sri Lanka, girls who have survived sexual abuse and have the courage to take their perpetrator to court are placed in protective shelters during their court cases. While living in these shelters, they are isolated from their community and do not have access to formal schooling. Consequently, these young women lack the education, skills, and capital to be self-sufficient when they transition back into communities. Without a support network or skills, and facing incredible societal stigma, it is easy for these young women to fall into future abusive relationships or be forced into the sex trade._x000D_
_x000D_
According to a study by CARE, 30% of Sri Lankans feel that if a girl is raped, she is usually to blame for putting herself into that situation (2013). Societal stigma can make it hard for known survivors of rape to find work, housing, educational opportunities, or even allies. “They are regarded as ‘spoiled’ or ‘damaged goods’ and rejected by family members and peers” (Squire & Wijeratne, 2009). As a result, survivors of sexual abuse are often vulnerable to commercial exploitation. When describing their own reality, survivors use terms like “trapped,” “heartbroken,” “lonely,” and “left to die.” _x000D_
_x000D_
A 2013 UN multi-country cross-sectional study revealed that a shocking 14.6% of men surveyed in Sri Lanka admitted to committing rape. Between 14-34% of college women in Sri Lanka report that they were sexually abused as a child (Perera and Østbye, 2009). 84% of rape victims in Sri Lanka are under 18 years of age (Women’s Bureau of the Sri Lanka Police Department, 2012) and 97% of abusers are known to their victim (UNICEF, 2012), many of whom are family members and the magnitude of the problem is only growing larger. _x000D_

The Solution:_x000D_
The Emerge Beads-to-Business Programme teaches girls business skills using jewellery design as a therapeutic and practical teaching tool. Girls work through a self-paced workbook that tackles concepts such as budgeting, inventory management, product development, marketing, branding, and financing. Throughout the programme, girls create and design their own jewellery, which enables them to generate savings for their futures._x000D_
_x000D_
The Beads-to-Business Programme is designed around a philosophy Emerge calls Collaborative Capital Creation.  Rather than receiving a hand-out or a loan, girls create jewellery in order to participate in the process of generating their own financial capital while also learning how to leverage this capital. This means that girls have ownership in generating their own capital but do not have to take on the risk of loan repayment, which is challenging for individuals with few support systems.  _x000D_
_x000D_
Through the Beads-to-Business Programme, girls not only generate capital but also increase their business acumen, leadership skills, and confidence. They build a network of support and mentors, and prepare for their lives as adults equipped with money management knowledge and job readiness. The girls who graduate from the Programme are empowered to improve their lives as well as their communities.  _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Design as a Critical Programme Component:_x000D_
Design is the foundation on which girls both heal and learn in the Beads-to-Business Programme.  The process of selecting colours and making choices about patterns and designs enables girls to express themselves and their sense of beauty and have control over a process. The simple act of making choices and beginning to design jewellery supports girls who haven’t had control or ownership over their own bodies, begin to heal. They are dazzled by the colours and shapes, the ways they can fit together, and the options they have in front of them. The process of designing and creating jewellery is meditative. Their world becomes something they can create in one sitting. Something that is beautiful and will help them build a strong future. As one of our participants put it, “beading frees my mind.”_x000D_
_x000D_
Jewellery design is also a critical way to teach core business skills. Through the design and creation of jewellery, we introduce concepts such as colours and trends, tools and raw materials, inventory management, product development, quality control, resource utilization, product costing, and more. Jewellery becomes a teaching tool that motivates and inspires the girls to learn. It’s hands-on business education._x000D_
_x000D_
The curriculum has four stages: (1) Learn to create jewellery and utilize the “Emerge Store” and “Emerge Bank” (part of a simulation of the economy to help girls learn to budget, save, and make basic transactions); (2) Run the Emerge Store and Emerge Bank, and mentor another participant; (3) Design their own products and plan a jewellery business; (4) Plan a business unrelated to jewellery design to understand how to apply their skills more broadly._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
A Financial Foundation for the Future:_x000D_
The girls are allowed to make as much jewellery as they want during the programme. 50% of jewellery sales go directly into a personal savings account of the participant who made the piece, and she is able to access that account once she has turned 18 or has left the shelter.  The remaining 50% of the jewellery sale finances jewellery production materials and shipping/sales costs, to make it a sustainable programme.  Making only 6 products per month, a girl could make ~$500 USD per year, a substantial amount in Sri Lanka._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Designing Community Change:_x000D_
Our curriculum will also support participants to collectively design their own community project.  This project will be sponsored through participants’ Community Fund, which will be composed of a small percentage of the profit of each piece of jewellery sold ($0.25/product).  This project encourages the girls to think critically and collectively about the challenges they have seen in their communities and about an aspect of their community that they would like to change.  By empowering participants to brainstorm, design, budget, and implement their own project, their experience their own capacity as well as the power of working together.  We believe these projects will encourage leadership and make Emerge participants more likely to engage in community building when they leave the shelter._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Design as a Way to Promote Awareness:_x000D_
The unique jewellery created by the girls has also become an effective avenue to create awareness about an issue that was previously taboo. Jewellery and fashion are approachable; child sexual abuse is not. Each piece of jewellery comes with information about Emerge and the majority of jewellery is sold in Sri Lanka. We currently sell in a number of well-respected boutiques across the country. We also provide kits for individuals who want to sell Emerge jewellery in their home or at craft fairs. These sales have started a terrific conversation and raised awareness about our cause. They have enabled us to increase our network, find opportunities and support for past participants for their reintegration in society, and grab the attention of influential individuals and organizations who can promote policy level changes in the country. Emerge’s distinct designs have been worn by a number of Colombo socialites, as well as former Miss Sri Lanka.  What was once an extremely taboo issue is now one that is being talked about by mainstream media regularly._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Geographic Coverage:_x000D_
Emerge programme participants are from all parts of Sri Lanka and are placed in shelters based on their court dates and shelter availability. Therefore, Emerge programming reaches girls who will take their knowledge back to communities across the country. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Ripple Effect:_x000D_
The impact of $25,000 will extend far beyond the young women immediately impacted, into their communities.  Past participants report that they after leaving Emerge they are a critical source of knowledge on financial matters in their family, business leaders in their communities, and that they aim to serve all girls who have survived abuse to help them heal and rebuild their lives.  At Emerge, we invest in strong girls, girls who we know will rock the boat and fight for a better future.  Emerge often works with girls who have survived abuse in their own families, and have has the courage to come forward, speak out in court, to work to protect their younger sister and to create a safe reality for their own children.  What if these courageous and resilient young women had the skills, resources and networks to enact their own visions of change? At Emerge, we believe these are the best investments we can make.  They will lead the change in addressing their community’s most pressing issues and creating a better future ","Within one year of launching programmes, we aim to have educated 60 girls through our Beads-to-Business Programme. It is expected that all participants will report decreased trauma, increased confidence, and increased belief that they can affect change in their communities. Out of the 60 participants we will work with, it is expected that 15 of these girls will start and run their own businesses, 15 of the girls will utilize their savings to complete their education and 10 on specialised vocational training, and the remaining 20 will use their savings to support their costs as they embark on their first job (e.g., rent costs, child care, first work clothes). ","Emerge works with girls between the ages of 10-18 who have survived abuse and have been removed from their homes while they courageously testify in court against their perpetrators.  Many of our participants have endured incest their entire lives and some have children as a result of rape.  As a result, they face many obstacles, including the following:

(1)	Trauma - Survivors often suffer from severe PTSD. Girls are often re-victimized during legal trail proceedings, where they have to relive their abuse in front of open / public court.



(2)	Societal Rejection - Social stigma and family-rejection can make it hard to find work, housing, educational opportunities, or even allies.



(3)	Lack of Education or Skills for Self-Sufficiency – The girls are institutionalized in shelters where they lack formal education, skills training, and supportive relationships. Integrating into society after years of living in such an institution leaves the girls vulnerable to unsafe relationships and work.-D"

I have self-funding the development of a demo portal that I will use for an upcoming beta launch. I've also garnered 387 user sign-ups and 5 residential complexes have come on board. While I'm proud of the progress I've achieved on my own through bootstrapping, I'm currently at an inflection point.  I can see clearly into the future to what ResSpot can become but I’m presently too cash-strapped to build a world-class, fully functional portal. The quotes I’ve received from South African digital agencies come to around R120,000 ($10,000 USD). However, ResSpot requires a technical partner and not a once-off agency, as the platform will undergo various iterations and improvements as it is tested in the market. Thus my plan is to invest $15,000 on hiring a full-time technical partner who will not only build a world-class ResSpot portal but also perform the day-to-day maintenance and upgrades required to keep it competitive and user responsive. Approximately, $4,000 will go toward hiring a young and bright female intern who I will train to be my ‘right hand woman’ and function as the business development lead for the business. There are a few female gap year students from African Leadership Academy that I have in mind for this role. I’ve already compiled a database of over 250 local service providers and over 150 residential complexes. The business development lead will work with the technical partner to increase this database by tenfold and upload the content into the system, amongst other projects. Another $4000 will go toward marketing and user acquisition costs. Through the surveys, interviews, and focus groups that I conducted with over 300 residents, estate managers, and landlords, a total of 387 users have already signed up for the beta launch of the portal. I plan to add to this number through on-site activations & promotions, partnerships with estate managers/body corporates, and a referral program.  The remaining $2,000 will be used to cover legal fees and company overhead costs – office space, telecommunications, internet etc. _x000D_
My vision is for ResSpot to become a major vehicle for communication & information exchange across Africa and a platform that empowers artisans, local service providers, and small local business – many of which are owned by women. After the model is perfected in Johannesburg, it will rapidly scale to Cape Town, Lagos, Abuja, Accra, Nairobi, and Cairo. Solutions for towns & townships will be incorporated to give more people access to the platform, especially those in disadvantaged communities. As millions of residents & local businesses register, communities will be able to collectively revive their local economies. Local offers & deals will incentivise communities to choose local businesses & female service providers over corporates. Through partnerships with local organisations & governments, ResSpot will become a powerful medium for the quick delivery of public service announcements, time-sensitive emergency alerts, and surveys to large communities, which will result in game-changing social impact._x000D_
_x000D_
Above all, I’m motivated to be the female African role model that I’d like to see in the entrepreneurial world & to be amongst other trailblazing women that show young girls that as an African female entrepreneur, you don’t have to feel pidgin holed into traditionally feminine industries like beauty and fashion in order to succeed. The platform provided by Project Inspire will hopefully help me inspire other young girls with big dreams similar to mine to know that their dreams are indeed valid and attainable._x000D_
","By July 2016, I plan to achieve the following: •	A fully completed, world-class ResSpot portal _x000D_
•	5000+ active users registered on the platform_x000D_
•	500+ local service providers registered on the platform, of which at least 60% (300) will be female-owned or composed of women _x000D_
•	Expand the team to include a full-time technical partner, a business development lead, and 2 interns. ","Across Africa, high security complexes with little interaction with one’s neighbour have become the norm due to fear & security concerns. As a sense of community declines, local businesses struggle to stay afloat. Skilled service providers that lack the knowledge of how to market themselves online become eclipsed by big businesses that do. Presently, residents find local service providers through Google, which leaves out a large subset of skilled service providers that lack a web presence. These service providers, majority of whom are women, often take what clients they can get and find themselves in vulnerable positions. Service providers like Lillian are sometimes cheated by clients who pay cash and refuse to give them the agreed upon rate after the service is delivered. Debit card payments on ResSpot will ensure that service providers are not cheated. On the platform, service providers will be ranked by customer reviews and merit, and not simply their ability to afford marketing.IA"

Our inspirational idea is to give back to the community through sustainable services and educate woman and children about the natural environment by creating mentorship programmes, permaculture garden design and sustainable development training programmes. Our aim is to inspire the local woman of the community to work independently and earn their own income, by doing so they create a sustainable working environment for themselves and future generations. By doing so we would want to create Eco –Literacy programmes which will educate women and children. We aspire to encourage and educate the woman and children of the local community of Redhill which is situated along the South Peninsula of Cape Town, South Africa. With the starting up of our legal entity which will be named GA Co-operative we will be able to generate our own income by providing services to local NGO’s and private companies which will benefit the woman and children of our and future generations.

Food is who we are. Arjun Appadurai, argues that “food can be used to mark and create relations of equality, intimacy or solidarity, or instead, to uphold relations signaling rank, distance or segmentation.” _x000D_
In the western part of Myanmar, the Rakhine state is one of the most remote regions in Mynamar. In 2013, the Director of Everything Grows and I traveled to the Rakhine state. It was not long after the violent strifes in the region that displaced over 140,000 Rohingya people. (WFP http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/Rakhine%20operational%20brief%20-%2010%20April%202014.pdf) _x000D_

Since 1978, the country of Myanmar, formally Burma, has been accused of crimes against the Rohingya people. In a recent article in The Economist magazine, the Rohingyas were described as the most persecuted people on earth (The Economist, June 2015). Rohingyas are banned from worshipping their Muslim faith, unable to marry or receive education and few are granted identity papers, making it difficult for them to travel or find legal work. In the article, the Simon-Skjodt Centre of America’s Holocaust Memorial Museum, described that the Rohingyas are “at grave risk of additional mass atrocities and even genocide.” In an effort to survive, many Rohingans are fleeing to Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Pakistan, and Malaysia. In these countries they are subject to similar oppression, working in inhumane conditions illegally with fear of being detained, arrested, exiled or sent back to their country. Cramped in refugee camps, detention centers, and small apartments or containers, families are often separated and not granted access to basic amenities. In situations like this, identity and food culture are a last priority. However, food as discussed before, has incredible power to nourish the soul and a people._x000D_
 _x000D_
As people are displaced and families are separated, it is likely that food traditions will be lost. My project seeks to collect these food traditions through recorded interviews. Stories of displacement, culture, and food will be collected into a recipe e-book that will be available for downloading. Funds will be used to travel and collect stories, recipes and interviews. In addition, $12,000 of the grant will be used for a one years rent and part-time salary for a female to run the Women’s Culinary Center in Thandwe, Myanamr. The center will serve as the collective space for women to discuss cooking techniques and recipes as well as a space for an elected 8 female member board to make bi-yearly decisions for dispersing funds generated from book sales revenue to members of the collective to purchase street vendor equipment and support small business ventures.","This is an extremely complex issue with no hard and fast remedies. Like many of the previous project inspire projects, Everything Grows' project is a small endeavor. But it has the potential to dramatically impact a few women’s lives and it can be replicated in other regions with displaced refugees. In addition, the cookbook which will be available for e-downloads will be a way for the Rohingya people to share their unique food culture and stories with the world- which may garner international attention and support for larger, more lasting remedies. ","The Rohingya are some of the most persecuted people on earth. This project seeks to address cultural oppression of the Rohingya people by celebrating their food culture and creating a cookbook to gain awareness and develop cultural appreciation in the country of Burma and internationally. It also seeks to address the critical economic oppression of Rohingya women by providing a possible source of income- food stands. As researcher Sharit K Bhowmik notes in the article Street Food Vendors in Asia, while food vending is considered informal employment, street food vending provides cheap, nutritious food to people and is a substantial source of income- particularly for women. A challenge that many of these vendors face, however, is capital. This project will help women to gain the capital to start food vending businesses that celebrate their food culture and sustain their families. IT"

In our catchment area, Both women and men face social economic  challenges like setting up their own businesses and making ends meet but for women the barriers are often greater and harder to overcome. They are often confronted with cultural values which largely favor men as superior and right heirs to family property. This limits women’s access to formal bank accounts, which prevents them from accessing loans or credit. The fact that many women receive limited education, skills training or career guidance only compounds these difficulties. At the same time, perceptions of family responsibility pose a challenge, with patriarchal attitudes restricting women’s responsibilities to domestic and family work, and thus preventing them from acting independently.

In the past, information was passed from generation to generation in form of storytelling. Every evening, children would eagerly gather at their grandmother’s ‘boma’ to listen to stories, tales and songs. However, in the strive for civilization, we have experienced cultural progression and in some cases decay that has sadly seen some traditional customs thrown out of the window.



There are many powerful stories of women that have gone untold and many triumphs unrecognized. There is a need for the African Narrative to be archived and shared. Stories by Africans to Africans and beyond.



Stories of hope, of anguish, of success, of challenges and triumph have been shared within Africa and the rest of the world.

Women at the top are increasingly lending their hands and offering their time to elevate the women and girls around them through sponsorship, mentorship and coaching support networks. While the former group of women are naturally time and energy resourceful, time and energy resources are limited. 'Quid pro quo' is a platform for those who have been helped by women at the top to give back and for those who would like to strengthen women at the top to pay it forward.TU"

Our platform is majorly an internet market that will help farmers to directly sell their produce to retailers and thus firmly establish the use of mobile money as a means of transaction between the two parties. In the process of marketing their products, valid bank accounts will be opened for the farmer to receive payments for the good sold on our platform and the retailers themselves will have to use e-payment platforms to buy from the farmers . This essentially gives retailers one location to purchase directly from various rural farmer and meet their volume demand. We know that most rural farmers in Nigeria are illiterates, hence our app will employ the use of USSD Codes to send and receive information from farmers. Any farmer with a 3000 Naira phone will therefore be able to use our platform which they will communicate with indirectly._x000D_
Our app will also help in proper accounting and book-keeping of farm transactions for the rural farmers to help create facility for loans and insurance for the rural farmer_x000D_
_x000D_
Also we will employ the knowledge and numbers of the National Youth Service Corps Members in each local community to help in training rural farmers with the 'how' to list, sell and receive money using their phones and use of the information such as weather information, seedlings loans information, fertilizer loans and prices and application methods information, current prices of goods,  that they will receive from our app. Organizing them in major groups at a major community centre, we will massively campaign the benefits that mobile technology presents to them._x000D_

","By the end of 12 months of the launching of our platform, we aim to have provide financial inclusion to over 50,000 rural farmers and aim to have raise their annual income by 500% through the provision of access to markets. ","First Problem

Rural Farmers contribute nothing less than  70% of the total National Food Supply yet they are arguably the most financially excluded group in Nigeria, and  Sub Saharan Africa as a whole. This means that a large majority of our agricultural sector producers  do not use any financial service or product to manage their finances. They transact using cash.  Most of them according to a 2012 study by EFInA, are women.



Second problem



In offering financial service to rural farmers, research has shown that offering services that facilitates debit and credit alone has not been effective, it is a combination with other key elements viz delivery of loans in the forms of seed and fertilizer directly to farmer villages, along with the provision of agriculture training, post-harvest storage support and market access facilitation, — that boost productivity and hence substantiate the aim of the financial service.

The project will be implemented in the framework of a Child Aid project started in Kingabwa in January 2012 that organizes 3000 families in 80 Family Action Groups (FAG), alongside a program funded by MDM (Médecins du Monde) to sensitize the families and in particular young girls on all aspects of sexual and reproductive health to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexual violence and link people to clinics and hospitals.  The idea of the present program is to empower women through training so they will play a bigger role in their families by increasing the women’s capacity to generate an income and by increasing the same women’s awareness of their rights. The women will earn money and improve their economic situation, and they will funnel their profits and new skill into activities that affect their own lives, and the life of their families. _x000D_
The project will establish a center where girls and women will be trained. Besides the technical training, participants will go through a life skills program to increase their general knowledge and learn about the female body, sexual & reproductive health, HIV&AIDS, women’s rights, sexual and domestic violence, children’s rights, nutrition and healthy living. In all the training courses the women will be organized in groups of 5, so they can support each other with the tasks list and later to get started with an income generating activity._x000D_
The training courses are built on the experiences from a previous skills training program in Child Aid Kingabwa financed by Stichting Humana (now Sympany), and will include some elements from training programs at INPP, the National Institute for Vocational Training. The teachers for tailoring and hairdressing will be recruited locally, but skills training teachers from INPP will be invited to share experience with the trainers in HPP-Congo. The project will also invite teachers from ISAM (Institut Superieur des Arts et Metiers). This institute trains young women as clothes designers and is supported by a number of partners among others VLISCO – the Dutch company that produces African style clothing. _x000D_
The training will include sessions about managing a personal economy with the goal to save money, and the microcredit institution FINCA will be invited to assist the women to open bank accounts. The project will cost 25,000 $ for a period of 16 months divided in 1 month preparation, 9 months skills training, 6 months follow up of each woman after completing training._x000D_
","By end of December 2016, 50 young women have been trained in tailoring and are starting a small income generating activity, and other 50 established female entrepreneurs have increased the turnover of their small business. All 100 women have increased awareness of women’s rights and sexual and reproductive health.","The Kinshasa province of DRC is composed of 24 municipalities among which the municipality of Kingabwa that is one of the poorest of the urban area of Kinshasa and is situated in the outskirts of the city. The population is mainly involved in small-scale business.   Women in Kingabwa have low social status, despite their important role of supporting their families, and youth unemployment is one of the major challenges this community if facing. Young people have few opportunities to enter into formal employment, and most young Congolese earn money from a day-to-day basis by trading on the local markets or to work as day laborers under precarious conditions. 

The proposed program aims at supporting women by providing entrepreneurial and vocational skills training and reducing gender disparity through education recognizing that better education is one of the key preconditions for reduced poverty. HH"

_x000D_
Since we want to serve the local market, having a well-supported production ensures that we constantly meet market demand, thus, there is customer retention and continuation of the livelihood program.  On the other hand, investing on trainings, references, and knowledge transfers ensure that there is enough skills and reliable human resource for the program to consistently deliver good results.","By December 2015, all batches of organic agriculture training of at least 400 women inmates must be completed.

Majority of the jail detainees in Davao City cannot afford bail and stay even up to six years in detention because of the slow justice system. In an interview, the chief inspector said, “A lot of these women are not hardened criminals. Most of them are here because of theft or drug pushing. When you ask them about it, they will tell you that they needed to do it to make money and support their children.” While life may have stopped for these women, the lives of their families outside are still in constant struggle of survival.  More than a means to rehabilitate and keep them busy, livelihood programs enable women inside to continue being mothers.

However, lots of livelihood programs in the jail are not sustained either because of lack of market, skill, support from authorities, or a low-risk trade platform to compensate the inmates.

2015,338,SE,Sweden,GH,Ghana,SE,Sweden,SE,Sweden,,Weather Forecasting for Female Farmers in Ghana,Ignitia AB,Ghana,Sweden,0,,"['Environment & Sustainability', 'Science & Technology', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Climate change and erratic weather are causing serious problems for rural farmers in West Africa.  Women, who play a crucial role in agriculture in Ghana, are particularly at risk, because they often are responsible for a majority of the domestic or subsistence farming.  When they cannot predict extreme weather events or make informed decisions, they are liable to lose some or all of their crops in a season, leaving them unable to make a living or feed their families. _x000D_
To help solve this problem, Ignitia has developed iska™ - highly accurate, localised weather forecasts that are delivered daily, monthly, and seasonally via sms. It will allow women farmers to manage these risks and adapt their agricultural strategies, such as choosing which crops to grow, or when to plant and fertilize. _x000D_
_x000D_
iska™ has been very successful, with nearly 900 new farmers joining the subscription each day.  We have discovered, however, that women are a minority of our subscribers, which means that the essential climate information we provide isn’t reaching many of the rural female farmers in Ghana._x000D_
_x000D_
Often, women are not targeted in campaigns that focus on agricultural innovation, and are underexposed to these new technologies. We plan to change this by creating a dramatic, interactive audio program that will educate women about climate change adaptation strategies, and raise awareness about the localised meteorological information we provide._x000D_
_x000D_
Over the course of five weeks, an audio drama, with 60 seconds airing each week, will be sent to 400,000 female farmers who own mobile phones. It will feature a short scene of a farmer and his wife making decisions about the coming season. A quiz at the end of each episode will give the women a chance to flash (to dial quickly, and then hang up) one of two numbers depending of if they think the couple made the right or the wrong decision. A call back will let them know if they were correct and provide additional agricultural tips. As an incentive to participate, they will receive a free week subscription at the beginning of the 2016 farming season, which will include the monthly and seasonal predictions.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The script writing and recording will take place in January while we are also developing the automated voice messaging technology with our current mobile partners, MTN. We will do pilot testing and make adjustments to the program in February in order to ensure the program can be broadcasted during March and the beginning of April, when farmers are planning their agricultural seasons. _x000D_
_x000D_
These dramatic programs are highly successful because they use local languages to engage women in developing countries who are illiterate or semi-literate, and do not speak English.  Subscriber information from MTN will also allow us to target female farmers directly, raising their awareness of climate change adaptation strategies, and giving them access to highly accurate weather forecasting.","By April 2016 we aim to engage 200,000 women by delivering a mobile audio drama that gives them access to accurate, localised weather forecasts, and teaches them the methods and importance of factoring weather into their agricultural decisions. _x000D_
We will send out 400,000 audio messages and expect a 50% engagement rate when accounting for factors such as charged phones, timing, and interest. We expect to reach an additional 440,000 women. This includes family members, with an average of about 2 additional females per family, and word of mouth advertising. Our own data analysis has shown word of mouth advertising to spread the service at a rate of about 20% of initial subscribers. ","We are solving two key problems. 1) the new meteorological algorithms developed by Ignitia use convection processes to offer much more accurate prediction than have been seen before in West Africa. iska™ has shown an 84% accuracy rate, compared with global competitors that only reach 39% in West Africa. This accuracy, coupled with the highly localised predictions ( 3km wide), give farmers the information they need to make informed decisions. A recent study done on smallholder maize farmers found that farmers could achieve as much as an 80 % increase in income only by using meteorological information (IRI 2012). 

2) We are addressing the technology gap between male and female famers. SEND Africa found that ”if women farmers had the same access to productive resources as their male counterparts, they could increase yields on their farms by 20 to 30 per cent.” By using an audio drama and targeting female farmers, we will decrease this gap and help empower women economically.•W"

Because of our strong relationships with these women, we will be able to incentivize them (through special loan terms, other financial incentives, childcare during classes and more) to enroll in this simple, effective learning-by-discovery life skills program. Most of the women we serve are illiterate. They also carry the primary responsibility for financially supporting their families, feeding and sending their children to school, and running their respective microbusiness. They have little time and no formal education to make a traditional instructor-delivering-a-lesson-to-a-student mode of learning attractive. Our curriculum therefore takes a different approach to win and keep their interest, making it fun to come to the class, interact and bond with other women like them, and discover a useful life skill. The curriculum’s Phase One is comprised of 20 lessons. For each lesson, we created a cinema-quality drama (length 8 to 15 minutes, shot and edited using the latest technology in film making). Each drama tells the story of a woman’s struggle and journey. In each lesson, a film is shown, then the instructor leads the class in a lively discussion (suggested lead questions are provided) in which the women share their opinions, feelings, ideas, criticisms and stories from their own experience. The discussion’s purpose is to lead women to think differently, for themselves, and to take small steps toward change, encouraged and affirmed by their fellow students and the trainer. Because they take an active part in discussing and pursuing a new way of thinking, i.e. they themselves discover new path(s), we expect this approach to more likely lead to personal decisions to make changes where needed in their lives. _x000D_
The curriculum covers topics like: pursuing one’s own dream and ambition, defining one’s identity, dealing with physical abuse, healing from sexual abuse, mindsets about female genital mutilation, attitudes toward singleness and spinsterhood, improving personal hygiene, creating boundaries, pursuing an education and much more._x000D_
_x000D_
Because we are focusing on participants in our micro loan program, one of the objectives of the curriculum is to impact the women we serve for the express purpose of increasing their business acumen and their earning potential._x000D_

The films have been created. The $ 25,000 grant will help us engage an accredited team of trainers to teach the classes over the course of our 6-month program pilot. It will also cover other costs like administering the classes and marketing the program._x000D_
_x000D_
Number of women we aim to reach is 1000. These constitute 5% of our current active micro loan client base of 20,500.

This has a direct impact on their earning potential and economic wellbeing—as well as their mental, emotional and physical welfare. The women in our program are the most marginalized and underserved in our society. Even though the great majority of them are the sole breadwinner for their family, no one has invested in them to help them take tangible steps to better themselves and grow personally and professionally. Their focus is surviving, not thriving. This curriculum is made to engage them in an effective way to make decisions for a better quality of life.

Solar energy is vital to support life on earth; solar electricity relies upon man-made devices such as solar panels or solar cells in order to provide a source of clean, and low cost renewable energy. The goal of the project is to improve access of rural women and children to portable water within three years with the use of solar powered pumping machines. The project plans to carry out advocacy and outreach in two selected rural communities of Osun State to enlighten them on the essence and importance of portable water and the necessity of its availability. The project will construct three deep wells in each of the selected communities. The wells will be enhanced with the installation of solar powered pumps and overhead tanks; this is to ensure the ease of drawing water resources from this initiative. The project will train three women in each of the communities of reach on the sustainable use of the solar pumps to ensure the longevity and proper maintenance of the pumps.

","The technology sector is one of Kenya’s fastest growing sectors providing opportunities for well paying employment to both men and women. Unfortunately few women are taking advantage of the opportunities in this growing sector of the economy. Unemployment is high among females simply because there are few employment opportunities available. The proportion of females with a job, formal or informal, is lower than that of males for all ages.Females’ relative disadvantage in accessing informal jobs is worst at around 25 years of age. In the case of access to formal jobs, the disadvantage simply widens throughout the entire youth period. Unemployed females outnumber unemployed males, the unemployment rate being more than 10 percentage points higher for young people aged 15 to 25 years.

While there are plenty of mobile apps in the international market to support cancer patients, the reality is that cancer is approached very differently in this part of the world and our culture plays a major factor. What works there doesn’t necessary work here, especially when you consider that cancer is still considered taboo in the Middle East. Fighting cancer remains very much a private battle for most women, who may not actively seek out the support groups available, but stand to benefit greatly from connecting with others and having reliable information accessible wherever they are while respecting their privacy. _x000D_
_x000D_
But in order for the app to succeed, it needs to understand these women and that’s where our experience working closely with patients over the past five years has equipped us to take on this task. We understand patients and we understand technology, which puts us in a prime position to lead such a project and realize its long-term benefits towards improving the cancer experience for patients in the region._x000D_
_x000D_
An average of 1,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in Lebanon alone each year and 50% of these cases are women below the age of 50. This young population (regardless of income level) is tech-savvy and engages regularly with apps on their smartphones (the majority of which are Android-based). We’ve already taken our first steps towards realizing this project through analyzing the apps available today for patients, developing the general framework for the app’s features and enlisting the help of Columbia Business School’s Pangea Advisors earlier this year to conduct a market study to better understand our demographic’s relationship to mobile technology. (I’ve attached the results of the research conducted and the recommendations provided by the students in the aforementioned program in the “Supporting Documentation” section below as reference)._x000D_
_x000D_
We are currently in the process of taking our ideas to the next level by developing the wireframes and functionality of this app in order to start planning design and build-out._x000D_
_x000D_
As such, we would be allocating all the funds received from Project Inspire to develop, design, launch and market the app in order to help as many women in the region as possible (especially as the app would be free for patients).","By December 2015, we aim to connect at least 150 breast cancer patients in Lebanon through the mobile app. It is expected that 50% of them will engage with the app, hence benefitting from its features before we expand regionally and to other platforms.","The problem we are trying to solve:- Connecting patients to support and valuable resources - many of which they don’t know about nor how to access, such as support groups, free wigs, etc.

- Providing a safe space to talk about cancer-related topics and share advice.

- Making credible and up-to-date information accessible to patients within the region.

- Offering them a chance to talk with a specialist in the field, whom they may not be able to reach or afford to chat with otherwise.

- Allowing them to track their treatment and put the power in their hands, especially when it comes to knowing their options and what to expect.

The ITP bridges ICAAD’s existing programs into a single space, so that capacity strengthening of women’s rights NGOs can improve economic opportunity and substantive equality for women, especially for survivors of violence and those in rural and outer island communities where subsistence markets dominate. _x000D_
The ITP will function as a platform that incorporates both design and technology elements by providing multiple products that can be efficiently accessed, while allowing innovative new products to be swapped to meet the more specialized needs of the beneficiaries of the ITP. ICAAD is laying the foundation to create an ecosystem that fosters partnerships capable of providing direct services that can supplement the economic empowerment work already being undertaken by women’s rights NGOs in Fiji. _x000D_
_x000D_
In 2014, ICAAD made a three-year Commitment to Action at the Clinton Global Initiative to promote access to justice for women & girls in the Pacific. The basic concept for the ITP was developed through numerous ideation workshops at Parsons New School for Design Strategies and has generated a broad interest from: UN Women, Thunderbird School of Global Management, DLA Piper, Linklaters, Colin Biggers Paisley, and within Fiji, the Fiji Women’s Rights Movement, femLink Pacific, Oceania Pride, and Youth Champs for Mental Health._x000D_
_x000D_
Our pilot program will provide access to: 1) pro bono services (e.g. TrustLaw, DLA Piper, Linklaters, Colin Biggers Paisley); 2) crowd-funding platforms (e.g. Crowdrise, Zidisha, Kiva) and global foundation partners (e.g. VGIF) supporting women’s economic empowerment; and 3) online business and entrepreneurship program designed specifically for women with the aim to fuel economic freedom (e.g. Thunderbird School of Global Management/ Dreambuilder Program). _x000D_
_x000D_
Access to the ITP would be contingent on resource sharing by local NGOs and trainees. This would include case studies, visuals that convey a poignant story, key reports, and data. Access to this information would be open to those who formally join the ITP and would facilitate synergies towards joint business enterprises, sharing best practices (e.g. business plan templates), and coordinated marketing and funding strategies._x000D_
_x000D_
The grant money will specifically be used to build the ITP, a Smartphone compatible application, design of the ITP, transdisciplinary partnership building, training of local women’s rights NGOs in Fiji who join the ITP, marketing of the ITP by highlighting our partners, and monitoring and evaluation. The training will show how to maximize the Dreambuilder program, the subsequent steps to take one’s business plan to the next level, key legal components to setting up a business, drafting of funding proposals, and how to access pro bono services to ensure compliance and good governance of one’s business._x000D_
_x000D_
Ultimately, with the success of the ITP, we will be able to open the platform to a broader audience of partners and beneficiaries in countries/ regions where we focus on removing structural barriers that perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls. _x000D_
_x000D_
","By January 2016, we launch and test a Minimum Viable Product. The ITPs design and user-interface will be evaluated by two local women’s rights NGOs before official launch. By April 2016, we launch the ITP and begin on boarding local NGOs whose clients are seeking to gain basic business skills or are positioning themselves to start/ grow a business. By June 2016, we will strengthen the capacity and institutionalize the ITP within 4 women’s rights NGOs who will train 75 women to use the ITP. We expect half of the girls to seek further specialization or begin the process of developing or growing a small business. _x000D_
By September 2016, we will partner with the University of the South Pacific’s (Fiji) business school, which could provide resources/ services to our trainees. Moreover, mentorship, boosting recruits, and growing partnerships will be priority. By end of 2016, 150 women will have graduated from the Dreambuilder course and 300 will have positively engaged with the ITP._x000D_
","The problem in Fiji is one of ACCESS. Women have limited access to: business education and skills training, pro bono legal services, and funding to start or expand their business. This is further complicated by VAWG and being in rural areas.

Women’s business opportunities are often limited to the informal sector: subsistence agriculture and market vendors. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) ranks Fiji 104th out of 183 countries in starting a business. In an IFC Report, women business leaders stated that VAWG impacts their workforce and productivity. In Fiji, more than 60% of W&Gs have faced gender based violence. The same forces that perpetuate VAWG, entrenched cultural norms and gender stereotypes, foster resistance to women working in the formal sector. Additionally, the difficulty in starting a business requires meeting several legal requirements. Thus, access to free or low cost services (pro bono) would improve women’s opportunity to start/ grow a business.

Our project brings these two aims together and encourages empowerment on all levels.This project is split into two sections which work in tandem with one another, an organic agricultural training course and an outgrower program._x000D_
The organic agricultural course will train 20 young women every 10 weeks. There will be one lesson a week for 10 weeks, and at the end of the 10 week period the young women would have finished a comprehensive course on organic agriculture. _x000D_
The second component is an outgrower program open to any interested graduates of the course who meet the requirements. The requirements include owning land; having infrastructure on the land like water; and agreeing to be fully organic. Precious Life is currently partnering with Organic Africa to implement this program. In the existing partnership, Precious Life is the outgrower and Organic Africa is the contractor. This contract relies on Precious Life being the reliable supplier of produce and Organic Africa being the reliable buyer and then distributor of the produce. _x000D_
In the Precious Life project, its role as an outgrower is simply extended to include not only its own produce but also that of small holder farmers who qualify. This creates a value chain from the small scale farmers who sell their organic produce to Precious Life who buys the produce for a fair price to the final exporter and corporate customer, Organic Africa, who then buys all the Precious Life and small holder farmer’s produce._x000D_
The budget will be split between the training and the outgrowing. The portion of the money designated for the training will go into paying the teachers, buying the course material and training tools, information handouts, stationary and one meal per lesson day. According to the proposal budget the cost of educating one woman amounts to $45 per girl._x000D_
The grant financing for the outgrower scheme will be used to equip the outgrowers with inputs such as tools, seeds and drip irrigation. And finally a portion of this will cover the administrative and logistical costs involved in transporting and weighing the produce. At present allocation the cost per outgrower is $248. Recognising the fact that the outgrower portion of the project is more expensive than the training portion, Precious Life will exercise stricter selection processes for choosing outgrowers, insuring that only the most potentially productive women are recruited.  But it should be noted that while only a limited number of farmers will become contracted outgrowers, we believe that many more will actually benefit from the project. this will be done by forming cooperatives around the existing infrastructure. We believe this will be an organic process instigated by the community and encouraged by the training. _x000D_
","By August 2016 (one year from the start of the project) we plan to have educated 100 girls in sustainable organic agriculture. From the 100 girls we aim to have included and recruited 40 of the women as members of the Precious Life outgrower project.After 80 weeks we plan to have educated a total of 160 women and have recruited 60 of them to join the Precious Life outgrower project. _x000D_
By week 80, 52 of these women should have earned an income from the Precious Life outgrowing project._x000D_
","Precious Life will aim to create solutions for gender equality and climate change mitigation. We aim to empower economically and socially vulnerable women by giving them the tools they need to break the cycle of poverty and be able to provide a healthy and sustainable living for themselves and their families. 

But in addressing gender equality we will incorporate our aim for climate change mitigation into a dual purposed solution that will solve both. More specifically in order to solve the problem of finding a suitable livelihood in agriculture, it is necessary to address climate change mitigation. By training women in sustainable and organic agriculture we are able to not only give them the tools to earn an income but also create an environmentally aware community that can deal with climate change and contribute to adaptation and mitigation.

Such indicators, however, seem to be lost on the experience of many Filipinos. Self-rated hunger and poverty rates remain static, and inflation remains among the top concerns of the majority. Social inclusiveness remains the most pressing pillar of the development agenda. _x000D_
Microenterprises are among the most impactful ways of addressing the challenge of inclusiveness. They allow resources and funds to circulate among communities, and create opportunities for productivity and income-generation in the grassroots. Among microenterprises, by far the most prevalent in the Philippine setting is the sari-sari store._x000D_
 _x000D_
Almost 9 out of every 10 retail outlets in the country are sari-sari stores: A neighborhood variety store that offers goods in the smallest quantity possible, providing an accessible outlet for low-income communities that may not be able to afford goods from larger groceries or supermarkets. Sari-sari stores are operated by women, usually stay-at-home mothers and wives who have no formal training in the retail business and who often lack a basic understanding of accounting and inventory management. This results in leakages in bookkeeping, and the lack of a clear overall picture of store profits and expenses. Ultimately, what are supposed to be engines of growth in the grassroots level are stalled by inefficiencies._x000D_
 _x000D_
These are the gaps that Sari wishes to address. Sari is a micro-enterprise empowerment project, meant to empower sari-sari store operators through greater financial knowledge and connectivity. With the use of technology, sari-sari store owners will have viewable metrics and data for more informed decisions, increased financial awareness, and commercial competitiveness. They will have a customized, easy-to-use suite of applications that will address their needs while enhancing their capacity to do business._x000D_
 _x000D_
The goal of the Sari team: to create and refine software what will help sari-sari store owners transition from a purely manual and analog system to a digital, cloud-based system using increasingly affordable smartphone technology. Integral to this is the development of SariScan software, an inventory management system for stores on a mobile device.  _x000D_

To develop the app, Sari needs to do:_x000D_
 _x000D_
1.     Launch a research initiative that will look further into the needs of sari-sari store owners;_x000D_
2.     Determine and design features of the app that will be useful to sari-sari store owners;_x000D_
3.     Gather a select group of 25 sari-sari store owners who will beta test the app for six months;_x000D_
4.     Consolidate hardware and connectivity requirements of the project for 100 participants;_x000D_
5.     Create a study what will determine the impact of the app on the participants_x000D_
 _x000D_
Sari promotes sustainability by providing a plan for hardware acquisition either through micro-financing or corporate subsidy. The SariScan app has a provision for an ad space revenue model that gives a trickle-down effect to its users. For example, to keep the unit cost down, ads can be pushed to the devices with advertiser shouldering part of the cost of the device. Retail data collected from phones can also be used for commercial market intelligence initiatives. The SariScan application can be easily modified to be deployed in countries with a similar retail structure._x000D_

"," During the duration of the project, Sari should have developed a robust, user-friendly software for the use of sari-sari store operators across the country. This entails several iterations of the application based on the input of key informant interviewees and focus group discussions among operators; a total of 12 such iterations will be undergone until the final version of the app. Key outcomes include: 1) wider coverage for the SariScan application, targeted at 100 stores; and 2) increased profitability for users.","On every street corner in the Philippines, there is a sari-sari store.

2015,328,GH,Ghana,GH,Ghana,GH,Ghana,GH,Ghana,,Mushroom cultivation technology for economic empowerment of women and girls in rural communities in Ghana,CSIR-Food Research Institute,Ghana,Ghana,0,,['Science & Technology'],"Dwellers in forest fringe rural communities in Ghana have been reported to like consuming mushrooms, although they are restricted from entering forests to carrying out various activities including collection of wild mushrooms because these forests are usually protected. When available, these collectors sell excess collected wild mushrooms for some income to improve their poor economic status. Mushrooms are Non-Timber Forest Products which have high nutritional and/or medicinal properties. The Mushroom Unit of CSIR-Food Research Institute in Ghana has conducted some studies on mushroom biodiversity assessment, domestication trials and nutritional content determination. Mushrooms can be cultivated on various agro-industrial wastes such as sawdust, rice straw, plantain leaves, and wastes from roots and tuber crops (cassava, cocoyam and yam peels), among others.With these results, some farmers, entrepreneurs and youth have been trained to cultivate domesticated mushrooms for income and improved nutrition and health while minimizing environmental pollution caused by improper disposal of agro-industrial wastes including sawdust and cassava and yam peels. Most of these trained people are producing mushrooms in Accra and its neighbouring towns. These activities have not extended to forest fringe rural communities in Ghana where there is high rate of poverty, malnourishment and related socio-economic problems, although they generate large quantities of agro-industrial wastes._x000D_
This project will seek to improve the livelihoods of women and girls in forest fringe rural communities through establishing them to be at the fore-front of the mushroom industry in their communities in the following ways;_x000D_
1.	Training in mushroom cultivation_x000D_
2.	Providing start-up mushroom production and preservation facilities_x000D_
3.	Developing market-linkages for sale of packaged mushrooms_x000D_
4.	Training on production of dried spent mushroom compost blocks for use as fuel to replace firewood_x000D_
Two hundred (200) promising women and girls (40 each from 5 forest fringe communities in 5 regions in rural Ghana) will be economically empowered by building their capacity to be at the fore front of the mushroom business in the respective communities._x000D_
Training workshops will be organized for these women and girls. Through these training workshops, knowledge and skills in mushroom cultivation will be impacted to these women and girls. They will also be taught about good practices in mushroom cultivation, as well as appropriate harvesting and storage methods. These workshops will be very practical to ensure that the appropriate skills are transferred to these women and girls. Pictorial hand-outs and fliers will be used in these training workshops. _x000D_
Mushroom production requires facilities including a composting platform, bagging shed, sterilization unit, and an incubation room and cropping house, both of which should have shelves to accommodate mushroom compost bags. These facilities contribute immensely to the start-up cost of the mushroom business. It is obvious that the rural women and girls do not have access to the financial resources required to enable them to practice the knowledge and skills gained during the trainings. _x000D_
In this project, one (1) each of these “Mushroom Production Factories” comprising of 1 composting platform, 1 bagging shed, 2 oil drums for sterilization, 1 inoculation/incubation room and 1 cropping house will be constructed in 5 selected forest fringe rural communities in different regions in Ghana, using locally available materials. _x000D_
The composting platform in each community will be large enough to accommodate at least 2 tons of compost at a time to facilitate continuous operation on the facility. The platform will also have a roof and fence to avoid leaching of the agro-industrial waste being composted by the heavy downpour in those areas as well as avoid disturbances from ruminants and fowls which may be in the neighbourhood. The bagging shed will be half the size of the composting platform and will also be roofed. The sterilization unit will be designed to be fuelled by firewood at the initial stage of the project. However, the firewood will be replaced with the dried spent compost blocks after the first. Both the incubation room and cropping house will be designed to have the capacity to accommodate 5000 compost bags at a goal. _x000D_
The facilities will be handed over to the trained women and girls who show the ability to practice the skills gained and manage the resources given to them. The 40 trained women and girls in each community will be grouped into four (4) groups of ten (10) and be given roles to play in this industry. One group will be responsible for producing mushroom compost bags, the second group will be responsible for producing good quality fresh mushrooms, the third group will be responsible for drying, packaging and marketing the mushrooms, while the fourth group in each community will be responsible for drying and marketing dried spent mushroom compost blocks for firewood to maximize the mushroom production value chain. _x000D_
Most mushrooms are highly perishable, having a shelf life of 2 days when kept at room temperature without the administration of any preservation methods. Surveys have shown that rural folk sun-dry excess collected mushroom. This preservation method has also been proven scientifically to be efficacious. One fabricated sun-drier will be provided in each community for this purpose, and the women will be trained on the use of these fabricated sun-driers and suitable, affordable heat sealers for packaging of the dried mushrooms for marketing._x000D_
Compost bags usually stop producing good yields after about 2 months. This would mean that these bags have to be discarded. However, it is known that these bags can be put to further use. It is also known that most households in these communities use either charcoal or firewood as fuel for cooking. In this project, the fourth group in each community will be taught how to effectively dry the spent compost bags for use as fuel. This will also include training on how to appropriately package these dried spent compost blocks for sale at a cost lower than the cost of charcoal as an extra income stream._x000D_
The progress of each group’s work will be monitored and technical support will be provided periodically over the course of the project._x000D_
Furthermore, information dissemination about the benefits of mushrooms and their cultivation will be done through organized workshops and the mass media (TV, radio and newspapers). This will be done in order to get more people interested in consumption of cultivated mushrooms, and thereby build a platform for marketing the mushrooms. In terms of the alternative fuel produced with the spent compost bags (dried spent mushroom compost blocks), there will be a lot of information dissemination and sensitization programmes to facilitate the adoption of this alternative fuel source by rural dwellers and other charcoal or firewood users. Videos of the training workshops will also be uploaded on YouTube and other social media for publicity pending agreement with the project funders. _x000D_
A baseline study will be conducted to access the socio-economic status of the women and girls who will be involved in this project. The socio-economic status of the women and girls will also be accessed at the end of the project and a comparative analysis will be done in order to assess the short-term impact of the project.","By the end of this project (February 2018) 200 women and girls in 5 forest fringe rural communities in Ghana will receive training in mushroom cultivation, packaging and preservation technology. Five complete mushroom cultivation and preservation start-up facilities will be handed to the trained women and girls. These activities will be carried out in the first year. Periodic group monitoring and technical support in the second year is expected to facilitate the efficient running of the mushroom business. Massive sensitization activities carried out in the second year is expected to encourage consumption of cultivated mushrooms in almost every household in and around these rural communities. It is expected that the groups of women and girls in these communities will eventually expand the mushroom facilities with income generated and even teach their children and others to participate in this business in the long term for continuity of the outcomes beyond the lifetime of the project.","People who live in forest fringe rural communities in Ghana are interested in participating in mushroom cultivation business, given the required training and start-up production facilities are provided. Most of them are poor and cannot afford the training and facilities on their own.Dwellers in these communities also encroach the forests for firewood, which is unsustainable and contributes to problems with forest management strategies. In forest areas, agro-industrial wastes including sawdust abound and are either burnt or used for burning wood for charcoal production. This is inefficient, unsustainable and causes environmental pollution and its associated problems.

This project will economically empower women and girls and minimize encroachment by dwellers in forest fringe communities through mushroom cultivation. It will also contribute to reducing environmental pollution caused by improper disposal/use of agro-industrial wastes, improving environmental sustainability.WB"

1. Diagnostics & Monitoring: CHWs will regularly record vital signs (weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc.) for each woman, screening for gestational diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The CHWs will use an automated decision support system to determine monitoring frequency and whether treatment referral is required. _x000D_

2. Natural Nutrition: MaMaBy has a delicious nutritional samosa, which was perfected on 5000 women in Mumbai during a clinical research study conducted by Southampton University. This study proved that when consumed by pregnant women, our samosa improves birth outcomes and reduces the child’s risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in their life._x000D_

This pilot will have two primary goals: (1) quantifying the impact of our community programme in the slum; and (2) assessing long-term sustainability or using sales of our natural nutrition in canteens & stalls to support the community programme in the slum.  _x000D_
","By the end of 2016, we aim to have one community health group and one kitchen operational. Our community health group will employ 2 FTE Community Health Workers (CHWs) and will reach 100 pregnant women from the slum communities. These women will receive health awareness education, nutrition and screening for gestational diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Through this, we aim for 80% of babies born to mothers on our programme to be healthier with improved birth weight versus the current average. Our kitchen will employ 21 women from the slum communities, providing fair and regular wages. These women will be responsible for procurement, production and logistics; we aim to train at least 4 women to drive for distribution purposes.

Risk factors for these conditions are shared: mainly poor lifestyle and diet. Women are often more vulnerable to these factors:  60% of impoverished people and 65% of illiterate adults are women; malnutrition affects twice as many women as men.

Diabetes and cardiovascular disease can first manifest during pregnancy; uncontrolled, they are likely to progress into severe chronic forms later in the woman’s life. The devastating impact goes beyond the mother. During pregnancy, these disorders and malnutrition, which affects 40% of pregnant women, cause permanent changes to the foetus’ cells, tissues and organs. This impacts foetal development and birth outcomes, leading to low-birth weight infants who are highly prone to developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in their lives.

Since the women in sex trade are trafficked at a very young age, they are illiterate and do not realize the importance of education. This contributes to the prevalence of the vicious cycle of intergenerational prostitution amongst the daughters of women in sex trade. Since education serves as a main weapon to fight second generation prostitution, it features as an integral aspect in the services provided to AAWC beneficiaries. Further, basic education is also used as one of the tools for empowerment of the women in brothel-based prostitution._x000D_
_x000D_
Current AAWC Services and Need Statement:_x000D_
While AAWC provides educational opportunities for both Umeed and Udaan beneficiaries through school enrollment, after-school tuition, Adult Literacy Program and basic computer class; the quality of educational material provided could be improved significantly through the use of technology as an engaging mode. The Adult Literacy Program for the Umeed women is conducted in brothels with no current use of technology. Also, there are no fixed or regularly scheduled computer literacy courses available for the girls. This proves a hindrance in the continuation of computer literacy education. Further, most Udaan beneficiaries attend government-run schools, which lack the motivation to provide informative syllabus and dedicated teachers. Thus, an important need arises for providing an engaging education system that continues motivating students to complete formal education, which could greatly be supplemented through technology._x000D_
_x000D_
Aim:_x000D_
In order to improve access to technology and quality of educational services provided to the beneficiaries, we aim to start two programs: the Mobile Computer Learning Program and the Computer Lab. These programs will provide access to innovative educational material through latest technology for both Udaan and Umeed beneficiaries. Thus, these programs will be used to supplement Adult Literacy Program, Computer Literacy as well as create awareness on health issues and diseases using technology. In Summary, the goals of both the Mobile Learning Program and the Computer Lab will be to:_x000D_
•	Enable wider access and use of technology through quality education in the Kamathipura area_x000D_
•	Empower women and girls by obtaining education through innovative methods and computer literacy skills_x000D_
•	Educate the beneficiaries about health related matters, its causes and prevention_x000D_
_x000D_
Components of the program:_x000D_
The Mobile Computer Learning Program will provide access to quality education to women living in the red light district of Kamathipura, Mumbai by utilizing tablet technology. While the ongoing Adult Literacy Program enables literacy in English or Hindi language and basic numeracy, the use of technology will allow us to expand the education syllabus to a more advanced level through the use of innovative applications. Women will have the opportunity to learn in their own regional language of communication such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, etc. Because women come from different parts of India, they speak their native language which might not at all be useful in Mumbai. This can also inhibit their ability to learn through our current program as they have to learn an entirely different language. However, with the Mobile Computer Learning Program they will be able to gain literacy in their own language._x000D_
Thus, the Tablets will be purchased and appropriate software and educational applications will be installed in it. Further, Outreach workers and other concerned AAWC staff will receive specialized training on how to operate the tablet technology. They will receive additional training on how to use tablets for educational purposes beforehand so that they are efficient while conducting classes. A trained professional will be hired to provide the required training to the staff and also set up the programs and applications for the curriculum on the tablets. _x000D_
We are considering partnering with with Classpad, an android tablet designed for educational purposes, or Apple iPad for Education. Classpad Educational Tablet provides access to various learning modules, e-Tests and games. The use of interactive based learning modules will engage the beneficiaries and makes the educational sessions more interesting. Game- based learning will be fun and can lead to delivering a high level of learning engagement amongst the women. Applications such as iWriteWords, abc pocket phonics and basics in grammar can be used on Apple I-pad. Also, EduPad is a tablet based educational system which uses tablets specifically focused in improving literacy rates in adults._x000D_
Thus, the Mobile Computer Learning Program will facilitate in bringing technology to the doorstep of women residing in brothels, which would otherwise be inaccessible to them. Also, technology will be able to cultivate the interest of women towards education and reignite their desire to learn. Another innovative aspect is using technology without dependence on electricity or internet that will facilitate long hours of tablet usage while commuting from one brothel to another._x000D_
_x000D_
The Computer Lab will provide Udaan beneficiaries and other women who visit the AAWC center with access to computers and a variety of educational programs and softwares.  The program will supplement the education Udaan beneficiaries receive in school and enhance their learning experience.  Regular computer literacy courses will be conducted by qualified teachers. The technology will allow the students to become independent in their learning and provide personalized content for students’ skill levels, interests and needs. The beneficiaries will have the opportunity to receive quality educational training in a variety of subjects through apps and software programs installed on the computers._x000D_
Health awareness sessions will be made interactive through the use of technology. Since the women suffer from various diseases and infections on a regular basis and also have various misconceptions about certain health and hygiene matters, an innovative approach to these sessions using tablets can help create permanent awareness and also reach to more women on field who might not necessarily step out of the brothels to attend awareness sessions at AAWC center._x000D_
_x000D_
Implementation Timeline_x000D_
_x000D_
November 2015 - Phase 1: Purchasing technology and installing educational applications and software. Fixing network problems and making internet available in computer lab space. In summary, the first phase will focus on setting up the required arrangement for the projects._x000D_
_x000D_
December 2015 - Phase 2: Training sessions by a qualified professional will be provided to the necessary staff on how to work with the computer/tablet applications and educational programs while conducting outreach. Month-long training sessions will be conducted for outreach workers and teachers._x000D_
_x000D_
January 2016 - Phase 3: Introducing programs to beneficiaries. For Umeed beneficiaries, the Mobile Learning Program will be incorporated into daily education sessions conducted by the outreach workers. For Udaan beneficiaries, the Computer Lab will be incorporated into daily tuitions conducted by teachers._x000D_

October 2016- Phase 7: Conduct another assessment as well as prepare a formal report to monitor the implementation of the projects._x000D_
_x000D_
December 2016- Phase 8: Conduct a final assessment through survey and report to finalize the impact of the projects. Also, make a decision regarding whether to continue with the project, after the final assessment is done.","By December 2016, we aim to increase the attention, engagement and involvement of Udaan (girls) and Umeed (women) beneficiaries through their respective projects; towards education by using technology as well as innovative teaching methods on the part of Outreach Workers to maintain the continuous flow of education. This will contribute towards the beneficiaries thinking of a brighter future away from the red light area on a long term basis. Also, we aim to see an increase in health related awareness of the women and their children and incorporate beneficial habits in their routine life.","Since the women in prostitution are deprived of an education due to being trafficked at a very young age, they find a simple task of holding a pen very difficult. Also, the negative environment around them dissuades the women from thinking independently which also results in their daughters not thinking of education as a vital tool for social change and empowerment.Further, since the women and their children live in unhygienic conditions, they are prone to health problems and also lack basic hygiene skills. Their environment exposes them to many mental and physical health issues such as psychological issues, sexually transmitted disease, menstrual issues, domestic violence, and emotional abuse among other diseases. They also harbor many superstition regarding health matters that prevents them from getting the required necessary support.

In conclusion, the project aims to address illiteracy amongst women and girls in the red light area and unawareness on health matters.TQ"

Since Nepal has poor economic conditions and unemployment is rife even among boys (and more so post-earthquake) families of these girls see no alternative to marriage. This project – Dreams Village – will focus on these young mothers who have received some form of prior education and provide incentives to them to continue their study as mothers or wives. In short, this project seeks to cultivate human development capital in young mothers. _x000D_
With the $25000 grant, the Dreams Village project aims to build and finance the activities of a center of `learning`, `training` and `practice` to educate and empower these women so that their learning can benefit the community, ultimately promoting equality. By partnership with Nepalese NGOs like `Can Nepal Help` (education), the `Socio-Economic Welfare Center for Energetic Woman` (micro-bank training), `Health and Development Society` (health care training),  Midwifery Society of Nepal (Maternal health and delivery training) and our international volunteers and visitors, we hope to provide life skills training and non-formal education while backing it up with behaviors support and mentoring. In doing so, we will be able to offer these young women an access to social empowerment. We understand that incentives and intervention is required for active participation in our programmes, hence, we plan to provide an economic empowerment opportunity.This grant will be used as seed capital to support the construction of a learning center, a health care facility and a small guest house -all in one building (the hardware). In addition, we will be able to fund the operations cost (software) with up to two years while being able to fund our job incentives and micro-credit programme.  Just like Future Village, we aim to keep Dreams Village a 100% administration fees free organization._x000D_
_x000D_
 A part of this fund will be used to provide incentives for these women to use their newly gained skills by working part-time as our health care center workers, door-to-door health volunteers, primary school teachers, maternal health counselors, organic farmers, guest house care takers, small business owners and future trainers of all of the above. The small amount of money the ladies will be able to make will offer a little better livelihood to them and their children. Further, the micro-credits programme will offer these women a chance to develop their small business ideas into reality. We expect some women each year to open a grocery shop, a tailoring shop, sell their craft etc. Moreover, as they learn in our education programme, young mothers will know more about maternal, sexual and children’s health. In a nutshell, we believe that by using this fund to initially kick start an educational-training programme where young mothers could acquire such skills and then apply it, train others or start their own businesses will create an economic system for women in the entire village of Katunge as we use the elements of technology and design to run this project. In doing so, international and domestic volunteers as well as Future Village`s collaborations with various NGOs will provide the kick start training for young mothers in the center at Katunge. In this process, we hope to develop partnerships with other organizations that will donate or sponsor for the growth and sustainability of our project beyond the two years. _x000D_
	_x000D_
","By February 2016, we aim to identify the location of Dreams Village and plan the construction of the Dreams House while Future Village and our international project panel introduces the project to the locals. Before monsoons in June 2016, we aim to finish the construction of the Dreams House. In the kick start year (zero), we aim to educate and train up to 30 women and fund up to 10 micro-credit projects. In the following year (2017), post-training, we expect to see up too 20 women staying on our job incentives programme. In this year (one) of the project, we hope to educate or train 50 women while providing micro-credits for up-to 15 projects. We expect that up to 20 of these women will stay on the job incentives programme. In 2018 (year two), we aim to provide micro-credits for up to 20 projects. As we work toward sustainability, we expect the already trained women taking lead in running all the programmes. In a nutshell, it is expected that we will impact 120 women in two years.   ","This project targets young mothers who have some prior education in schools at Katunge, still are the weakest group in the village as they marry their husbands and become overly dependent on them, often forgetting their dreams! Other NGOs in Nepal seldom focus on this. We are solving three problems which are as follows.

1. Lack of education and training: by providing necessary education like maternal health, and by providing life skills training. 

2. Social & economic empowerment: when women learn something and benefit the community, they are socially empowered. They are economically empowered when they are provided incentives to do so! 

3. Equality: the idea that after marriage the girls is not useful, we want to change that.

Most of them are forcefully married off by their parents. It is well documented in Sebei region in Eastern Uganda that many girls are vulnerable and fail to progress through life. The region has huge challenge of female genital mutilation (FGM), early marriages and pregnancies, the vices that have made many girls of school going age to drop out of school and perform poorly. For instance, although the government introduced universal primary and secondary education, rates of literacy and school enrollment in Sabiny region have renamed very low compared to national rates. Therefore, I have been thinking how help the girl child from my community to withstand these numerous challenges. Yes, there are number of Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) helping to support the child, but most there activities are focusing on the post recovery programs such supporting circumcised girls, looking after pregnant girls and teenage mothers.  Programs that are preventive in nature are lacking. Indeed, my life experience as girl child from the Sebei region, I have realized that for a girl child to make it through life amidst these challenges, need someone to look up to. Nonetheless, my experience and interactions with University students at Uganda Christian University has convinced me that for a girl from my region to make it in life, there are people who were there for them, people who inspired them to excel, helped them to know and discover their potential and rights. _x000D_
_x000D_
Therefore with support from Project Inspire, I will be able mobilize and organize female students at University from Sebei region to act as “ambassadors’ of change in areas where they grew up from.  Operationally, l will mobilize 20 female student ambassadors in the first year of the project; the criteria will be to choose those student ambassadors who grew up and studied in Sebei region. The 20 student ambassadors will organized into a group 5, four ambassadors in each group. Each group will be tasked to visit a selected school twice in a school term, translating into 6 visits in a year for each team. During the school visits, the ambassadors will have the opportunity to share their life experiences of how they were able to make it amidst the same challenges the school girls are going through. The diversity of the experiences of the ambassadors will address the numerous questions and challenges the girls are facing. This will sparkle and empower girls to withstand pressures, work hard and discover their potentials. For sustainability and to allow continuous interaction between the ambassadors and girls, clubs will be formed in every visited school. A club will consist of 10 girls and each club will be attached to student ambassador as mentor. This implies that in each school visited, 4 clubs will be formed.  The clubs will for a platform that allows the club members to share their experiences and lessons learnt to other students in the schools._x000D_
","By the end of first year of the project;1. 500 school girls will be visited and empowered through sharing our life experiences_x000D_
2. 20 clubs will formed in the five selected schools_x000D_
3. 200 students will attached to university student ambassador as mentors","It is an uphill task for a girl from Sebei region to study and reach university. It requires a lot of inspiration for a girl to withstand the pressures from practices such as FGM and early marriages.  My experience and interactions with students from Sebei region has revealed that the region lack interventions to help the girl child to manage the numerous challenges they face. The parents and the community, who would have been the source of support and inspiration, are the ones who are promoting the practices that hinder girl child education. For instance, whereas the government passed law against Female Genital Mutilation in 2010, evidence show that the practice is still cherished and strongly guarded by the elderly in the community.  Nonetheless, in business and other spheres of life, people who are successful have been used as source of inspiration to amplify those who are lagging behind. Such initiative has not happened with girl education in my region. AA"

Participating girls will also learn and use supplementary technological skills of photography to make their advocacy efforts more effective. The girls will use this technological knowledge to create advocacy material such as community newsletters, posters and photo essays, and through these media will present their perspective on their access to basic rights and government services. They will present their views to community leaders and local elected government representatives to advocate for more sensitive, accountable and efficient provision of services and implementation of policies.The prize amount of USD $25,000 will be used with the participating girls for conducting training sessions in computer and photography skills, creation of advocacy material, imparting knowledge of their rights and advocacy methods, and presentation of girls’ perspectives to authorities and stakeholders. The grant will go towards building girls’ groups in underprivileged bastis (slum communities) who develop an understanding of rights and leadership, and learn to use simple technological tools for gaining these rights. The focus will be on making these groups sustainable by teaching them technological skills that they will be able to access even after the project is over, and which they will be able to multiply by passing them on to other girls in the community._x000D_
The project amount will go towards building holistic and sustainable leadership of girls belonging to underprivileged groups. Girls from these groups form one of the most marginalised groups in society, suffering multiple disadvantages of caste, class, gender and age. To add to this they are also one of the most under-represented groups politically, which is why their voices hardly ever reach policy-makers. Girls, especially of disadvantaged groups, do not possess the skills, knowledge or exposure to be able to express themselves nor do they have access to resources and platforms where they can present their views. This project aims to enable girls to gain accessible skills that will be easy for them to use so that they can effectively participate in public life and represent themselves. Participating girls will use technology to collate and present gaps in access to basic Rights such as Right to food, Right to health, Right to sanitation and Right to safety. The project amount will be used towards building such girl leaders from the grassroots who will mobilise and mentor other girls and young women from their communities._x000D_
","By January 2017, the project aims to train 100 girls in the age group of 11-18 years in computer and photography skills. It is expected that these girls will gain an understanding of their fundamental rights, and methods of advocating for and accessing these rights. The project aims for these 100 girls to go on to create advocacy material in the form of community newsletters, PowerPoint presentations, posters and photo essays to present their voices about their access to rights and resources. Of the 100 participants, it is expected that 50 girls will then use the technological skills they have learnt to engage with 500 other girls, women, boys, men and other stakeholder groups of the community to create awareness about individual rights of women and girls as well as rights of the community. The 50 girls will present these collective voices to influential local leaders and elected representatives to advocate for their own and their community’s rights by using their advocacy material.","This project aims to solve the problem of underprivileged girls’ access to rights and resources by enabling their access to technology. Access to technology itself is denied to most girls from disadvantaged groups – either due to lack of purchasing power or because of gender norms that impose strict controls on them. In a situation of limited means, girls are the most neglected in terms of nutrition, education and health. When girls reach adolescence, their access to mobility and resources further deteriorates due to increased restrictions, prevalence of child marriage, poor nutrition and inefficient health care services. According to 2011 census, 18 lakh girls in India are married below the age of 15 and 41% of girls below age 19 are married, with many of them divorced, separated or widowed. Girls have little opportunity in such a situation to develop themselves as participative citizens. There is little understanding of their needs in policy-making and urban design and development.FM"

We educate and assist them learning how to process the excess fish into Juku Kalotoro (healthy dry fish package) and Abon Sehat (Healthy Shredded Fish) product. The initiative is not merely to produces an Indonesian national food (snack), but is also a campaign for healthier lifestyles as the product does not contain MSG and preservative. Our social business engages local women (fisherman’s wives) as the main actors. Our assistance to the local women’s group mainly focused on helping them to be a sustainable self-helped group. We facilitate and educate them on economical production process, hygiene aspect, project management, financial literacy, packaging, marketing strategy, and licensing for food production from health department. _x000D_
Our social business concept focuses on healthier processed food product. Shredded fish is one of the main choice by the coastal community. It consists of high nutrition (omega-3) for children, and the children are familiar with and like the product. Other than to local communities, we also sell the product to campuses and hospitals around Makassar city, targeting over 10,000 university students. We already have consignation agreement with several university co-ops. We also have signed agreement with Selayar State Hospital to provide the product for its patients in monthly bases. We are also using social media to market our product. We already have customers in other cities in other provinces, such as Jakarta, Bandung and Tangerang. _x000D_
_x000D_
We are planning to maintain the production plan (12,000 packages or 1,200 kg Abon Sehat per year), create sustain raw material supply (fish and spices) and improve storage management to control the quality of excess fish before the production. Since the introduction of Abon Sehat in social media, there are increased demands and we will fulfill it by increasing the production. It is expected that the increased demand will increase the profit and bring more impact to the welfare of the women group as a way to improve their livelihood and out of poverty._x000D_

Our social business has already reached the Break Event Point on month 11. Nevertheless, we would like to expand production to meet the increased demand, as well as to improve production process and replications in other parts of Indonesia (to help local fisheries communities in other part of Indonesia). On the fifth year we will have 28 center of production in 28 islands, and will replicate the initiative in Java, Borneo and Sumatera.

The main problems faced by the fisherman are the treatment to maintain the fresh fish quality, the alternative for preservative and the price of the excess fish. There are fisherman group selling 400 Kg of fish for only USD$ 0.1 per Kg to reduce their loss because of limited access to get ice cubes due to electricity failure for a week (Radar SulBar, local newspaper). They only get USD$ 40 from selling 400 Kg of fish while the cost for one trip fishing is around USD$130. The same problem happens in Selayar Island.

Not only sending donation, the sponsor also communicate with the children through letters and the children’s progress report. We need to send reports, letters to each sponsor, and vica versa. Our research shows that this positive interaction between sponsor and the children contributes much on the success of the children, along with the financial support itself. With growing number of sponsored children, we need to think of the use of technology and design to facilitate our program. Therefore, we would like to propose a Golden Bridge project, which will be able to bridge communication & coordination among our stakeholders in more effective and efficient way, and thus contribute to the improvement of education in Indonesia. Through this project, we plan to:1.	Build an Informatics & Computer Technology System (ICT System) and mobile apps, which enable our sponsors to check regular report and letter from their children, update the foundation’s information, confirming their donation and many other function. Not only between sponsor and the children, this ICT system will also bridge communication among our area coordinators, who need to send us the profile of our children, and regular reporting. It can be a communication center for all of our stakeholders, from our sponsors, children, area coordinators, volunteers, and the Hoshizora Foundation itself. It will also enable us organizing our financial record and report. In addition, it will enable public to sign up as a sponsor, and a child to request a support online, thus innovate our way to connect those who have and do not have. _x000D_
2.	Build a coordination design for bridging communication among coordinators in all over Indonesia. Having Indonesia as an archipelago, comprising thousands of islands, currently we have limitation on coordinating with our coordinators in many other different islands. It is also making so much differences, in which some areas have electricity, and some may not; some are very remote, and some are in the city, and other many cultural and education background differences. Therefore, it is very important to build a coordination design to ensure that we are working as a team, and moving to the same direction. The coordination design will include regular meeting and discussion, benchmarking as well as capacity building for our area coordinators._x000D_
We believe that the ICT system, mobile apps  as well as coordination design for our coordinators will build a golden bridge to connect those who have with those who do not have, and ease communication process of all stakeholders in Hoshizora Foundation. Finally, we believe that it will bring  a new hope for thousands of children in Indonesia, by providing them an education access and a motivation to have a dream and achieve it._x000D_
","By November 2015, we will finish the 1st phase development of our ICT system, while by May 2nd 2016, along with Indonesia Education day as well as the Hoshizora Foundation’s establishment day we will finish our final version of the ICT system and mobile apps. It will definely mark the social innovation for our education. By May 2016, this system will accommodate support of 1000 impoverished children in Indonesia, and expect to grow to 1250 children at the end of December 2016.To support our growth, we plan to finalize our design for coordinating our area coordinators by December 2015, and execute it from January 2016. By August 2016, we plan to have as many as 35 area coordinators in all over Indonesia to assist 1250 children at the end of December 2016._x000D_
We expect that 1250 children that we support every year will continue to go to school at least until senior high school, and have a better future. We believe that their education will be a key to their economic  empowerment._x000D_
","This project will amazingly innovate our way on connecting those who have and do not have, thus solve an access of opportunity and education for impoverished children. It will innovate the way that public contribute to education by feeling so much easy to contribute and able to see how their contribution impact the children. In more details, this project will solve complexity of communication between sponsor to the children. If before we have to send our progress report one by one to each of our sponsor, by having the ICT system we will be able to send it automatically, and of course many other functions

This project will solve many of our manual works, which has possibility of human error, shorten necessary time to finish a task, and make our work more efficient. 

In addition, the coordination design for our coordinators solve communication limitation among Hoshizora and area coordinators due to far distance. Finally, it will solve our challenge to handle big numbers of sponsors.W1"

2015,313,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,,HeartPrint,TOUCH WORLD ,Singapore,India,0,,"['Education', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Time in prisons is designed to reform criminals so that they re-enter society as responsible citizens. However, when released, women lack vocational skills and face discrimination from time in prisons, even from their families and neighborhoods, leaving them financially and emotionally vulnerable. These are the very conditions that often led to crime, condemning them to a cycle of poverty and crime. Therefore, successful re-entrance into society requires vocational and emotional preparation of inmates through professional engagement with the creative arts, and the trust and acceptance of society and future employers through the reduction of stigma and empathy. _x000D_
Touch World eases this transition back into society by teaching the creative arts to inmates of Correctional Homes. The women learn creative skills like music, dance, oration and theatre, from professional trainers, which culminate in a public dance performance. Through this performance, they gain practical experience in performance, music orchestration, sound design, costume making, and event management and strengthen their self-esteem as they redefine them as artists and performers rather than criminals. _x000D_
_x000D_
We plan to use Project Inspire funds to expand our operations in three steps. The first is to cover production costs. Touch World has already grown from one to three correctional facilities in West Bengal, India, and the inmates have put up 90 shows across India in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata, performing in prestigious art and dance festivals. Widespread appreciation of our productions is essential for our performers to be recognized as professional by themselves and future employers. We will allocate $10 000 to this. _x000D_
_x000D_
The second is to increase the number of committed trainers, formally hiring current and new trainers so as to ensure a small student-teacher ratio and professional standard for our public performances even as we undertake bigger productions with more participants. Many of our dance trainers are currently teaching pro bono, leaving their commitment and training quality dependent on their financial stability and spare time available. The success of our performances has allowed us to establish the Prisoners Welfare Fund, which serves as remuneration and helps to fund the prisoners when they have family emergencies and has accumulated USD $150 000. Dedicated teachers are needed to grow this success. The production also serves as the key platform for showcasing our performers’ abilities and discipline to the public so as to enhance future employability. We will allocate $5000 to this._x000D_
_x000D_
The third is to help fund school classes for the children of the prisoners who live within the prisons along with their mothers. It is essential for future of the girl child to have the opportunity to be educated in her formative years. However, girl children between the ages of 2-6 who are forced to live in prisons with their mothers, rarely get this opportunity. Touch World has begun offering classes to benefit children within prisons and we hope to expand the range of courses offered as well as our reach. We will allocate $10,000 to this. ","By April 2016 we aim to train 95 women in dance, drama and other vocational skills and by December 2016 host at least one professional production. There has been a rising trend in the interest and support of the society, with the last production seeing overwhelming success with over 16 show performances in the past year. We expect the trend to continue and expect to have over 5 performances of the production in the next 5 months. It is expected that 90% of the released women inmates will go on to secure employment, establish small businesses building on the skills learned or pursue further specialized performing arts training, based on the success of our participants released recently . ","Design is a way of thinking or planning rather than any specific product. Whether it is choreographing a dance routine or painting props, female inmates learn to harness and redirect strong emotions, learning creative design. Through engagement with the creative arts coupled with vocational training, we equip female inmates with both the creative and practical ability to design their own careers upon release. In addition, by educating their children who are forced to live in prisons along with their mothers till the age of six, we ensure that they are not deprived of opportunities and can rejoin schools on an equal footing with other children, upon their mother’s release.PN"

","In Kolkata there is an active culture of street food which is prepared in unhygenic and unhealthy methods and causes people to spend on preventable health issues. Prasaad will reinvent the culture of street food to provide blissful food experiences that make the body feel good too. Prasaad will also reach 12 key marginalized communities in Kolkata where children and families have little access to good nutrition and hygiene, which lead to gastric ulcers, diarrhea and other health problems. Children face pressure to help their struggling families earn money which leads to issues of early marriage, child labor, high dropout rates from school, continuing a legacy of unskilled daily wage earning and financial insecurity. Prasaad will provide many girls and families an opportunity to learn a specific industry, know how to manage their own businesses, continue their education, shift attitudes on gender roles, and improve their families’ and communities’ health habits and environment.

It will expand an innovative, multi-pronged approach to empowering survivors of domestic violence by linking women with a full spectrum of services to transform their lives.   This includes access to immediate support services, legal and family counseling, and vocational and financial services to increase their financial independence, creating a true pathway out of violence. Specifically, the grant will replicate the Gender Resource Centre (GRC) model that CSR operates in the Northeastern District of New Delhi in one location in South Delhi to expand vocational training and financial services for survivors of violence. _x000D_
_x000D_
The current GRC is supported by Delhi’s Mission Convergence program which establishes GRCs across the city in partnerships with NGOs.   These centres offer a range of services to support women including access to information about government schemes and vocational training services._x000D_
_x000D_
The project goal is to empower women to stand up to domestic violence by supporting their economic self-sufficiency.  The women in this project will be trained in beauty culture and tailoring and will participate in Self Help groups for financial literacy training and support in operating as entrepreneurs.   The project will also link women to employment opportunities within their field of study._x000D_
_x000D_
CSR operates six Crisis Intervention Centres (CICs) across Delhi that provide family and legal counseling to victims of violence and a range of community awareness generation programs.  The proposed project is part of CSR’s plan to design and offer integrated resources for victims of violence.  The plan includes expanding psychological counseling and medical services at the CICs as well offering vocational training to help women transition to an independent source of financial support so that she and her children can make good decisions about how to best eliminate violence from their lives. _x000D_
The $25,000 grant will be used to replicate the training program in one additional South Delhi location in close proximity to the existing CICs and to establish and run SHGs that will support women entrepreneurs and provide basic financial literacy training.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The current program serves roughly 75 women per year with training in beauty culture and tailoring.  The project seeks to expand this work to train 150 women per year in CSR’s program areas._x000D_
_x000D_
In subsequent years, the program’s offerings will be expanded beyond beauty culture and tailoring and linkages with a new vocational training institute that CSR is establishing in Gurgaon will be established and reviewed.  CSR is converting a property in Gurgaon into an institute that supports the vocational development of women and other marginalized groups.  As the plan and design of the institute develops, CSR will establish a scholarship and referral network within its CIC communities to link women with more educational opportunities to further strengthen their financial independence. _x000D_
","Over the first year of operation (by December 2016), the project will train a total of 150 women in vocational skills development.   We aim for at least 50 percent of these women to be women recovering from violence in some form.   The program will be open to all women in the community. ","Domestic violence is a major problem in India and New Delhi in particular.  Nearly one in three women will experience violence at some point in her life.  The majority of women will experience this violence at the hand of a husband, family member, or intimate partner.

Social and cultural norms that establish women as dependent on men for their financial wellbeing   contribute to the perpetuation of violence and limit women’s options for escaping violent situations.  Without a means of independent livelihood, women remain dependent on men and family for their financial security. 



Evidence suggests that programs that offer a full spectrum of support services to women experiencing domestic violence are the most effective in helping women escape violence (for example, the one-stop crisis centre model established in Bangladesh).  Offering vocational development training to women who have experienced violence will complement the crisis services that CSR already provides. TO"

We have been hiring sewing machines and cameras used by women for training and since we are anticipating to increase the number of women we will train, it will not be sustainable to carry out the training efficiently. We seek to produce quality products and services hence we require more equipment to produce these results. Each year after training we incubate businesses started by the women and we will give them support at the center by giving them access to the equipment hence we need money to be able to acquire more equipment.Below is a breakdown of how the money will be used to buy the equipment:sewing machines	             4,000.00 _x000D_

The current space we operate in does not have adequate space to cater for the children of women who are on training hence we need to renovate the work-space so that women can have day care services for their children whilst they train. Computer skills are a basic skill each woman enrolled at Camyskills should have as they will enable them to design products they will make using their skill. We need more laptops to carry out training efficiently. After producing their products, often time women do not realize much return as they do not package their products well. We intend to buy packaging equipment that will be used to package the jerseys,shoes,cakes,snacks and clothes made by women._x000D_

","By December 2015 at least 300 women should have gone through training  and be equipped with a skill that will enable them to earn an income.500 women should have participated in our open community trainings and workshops. Of the 300 women enrolled at Camyskills 80 are expected to further their education, 20 should have their business incubated at Camyskills. Direct impact on the 300 women enrolled at Camyskills will be that they will be able to use technology in designing their products and those in photography and video-graphy will be able to use software to edit pictures and videos. The 20 businesses started and incubated at Camyskills will benefit from enterprise development services and also be able to access equipment at the center to grow their businesses. We expect to employ at least 200 women after training so that they can contribute financially to their families.","Women in my community are being faced with issues of gender based violence and have no skill to sustain themselves and their children so that they can leave their abusive relationships. Some women have been involved in trade but are lacking value addition skills in order to maximize their economic gains on their products. Camyskills creates a platform for women to learn production and value addition skills so that women are competitive in supplying the required products on the market as well as find space on the international market. We use technology in the designing of clothes,shoes as well as handbags. Each woman will go through basic computer skills training as most of the women do not have the skill. In our baking classes we encourage women to use technology in printing and making designs for the cakes.  Women are also given an opportunity to further their education as there are free tutorials offered at the center. We encourage women to study up to degree level.WW"

We use human-centered design methodologies to provide a hygienic, accessible, and affordable sanitation option that appeals to residents of Nairobi’s informal settlements. We regularly collect the waste from each toilet, remove it from the community, and convert it into valuable byproducts for safe re-use. _x000D_
This project seeks to support women in navigating regulations to set up their own sanitation business and gain access to land._x000D_
_x000D_
Residents of the slums have to resort to three main sanitation options: they can pay to use large public toilets, which are located far from people’s homes, making them unsafe for women and children to access at night; 80% of residents pay to use unhygienic pits that drain into waterways; or, they use “flying toilets,” defecating in a plastic bag and throwing it into a public area._x000D_
_x000D_
Our Fresh Life Toilets are a hygienic, accessible, and affordable sanitation option designed specifically for residents of urban slums. They are compact and can fit close to people’s home. As we want to reach the most vulnerable members of the community, it is important that available spaces are used for hygienic sanitation options. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, in Nairobi’s slums, land tenure is a consistently complex issue. Residents have restricted access to land, making it difficult - especially for women - to secure permission to establish a business. Entrepreneurs hoping to set up Fresh Life Toilets must seek permission from local authorities to build on communal land. Area chiefs and county government administrators reserve the right to verify the appropriateness of land before giving approval for any structure to be built._x000D_
_x000D_
Women find it difficult to approach sitting government officials with requests to use available communal spaces due to a cultural bias around women approaching authority figures, the majority of whom are male. At the same time, women in informal settlements tend to have a lower literacy level than men, and thus face greater difficulty navigating the civic processes on land. The majority of women also lack business and political networks to successfully navigate these intricate and convoluted processes on their own. They are therefore particularly restricted when it comes to accessing land and being able to set up a business.  We will offer them with specific access to credit through 0% interest loans by Kiva. _x000D_
_x000D_
My Government Relations team engages local government authorities to create an enabling environment for potential operators to get approvals for land, especially women.  This grant of USD 25,000 would greatly contribute to helping us to reach more women as we expand our activities to new areas and promote gender equality to public authorities - allowing women to become not only beneficiaries but also actors of change.  ","•	By December 2015, we will aim at having our existing Government Relations team is trained and equipped with skills for championing land access for women;_x000D_
•	Each team member’s time will allocate specific one-one-ones with women potential FLOs to assist them specifically in securing land;_x000D_
_x000D_
•	Our Credit Team will follow-up on those women to help them access the right financial tools and strive as entrepreneurs;_x000D_

•	Four quarterly forums will be held (power breakfasts, discussion forums) for government officials - to build awareness, discuss interventions and policy changes on the process for land access for women;_x000D_
","4.1 billion people in the developing world lack access to hygienic sanitation. The resulting diarrheal disease kills 17,000 children annually in Kenya. The problem is particularly acute in slums, where populations will double to 2 billion by 2030. Sanergy takes a systems-based approach to solving the sanitation crisis in urban informal settlements, starting in Nairobi, Kenya. We assist the entrepreneurs running Fresh Life Toilets - the Fresh Life Operators - with a business-in-a-box and regular trainings to help them strive. We specifically help women by providing assistance in navigating the approval process for access to land, currently a major barrier to running their own Fresh Life Toilet as a profitable business. As women are more likely to invest additional income in education and health, it is important to empower them when trying to solve the sanitation crisis and fighting poverty in those areas. We advocate for gender equality when interacting with local authorities.TI"
2015,301,US,United States,UG,Uganda,US,United States,US,United States,,Microfinance Loans for Filters to Women,SPOUTS of Water,Uganda,United States,0,,['Health'],"With $25,000, SPOUTS will increase access to clean drinking water access. We will work with our local partners to offer micro-loans to women village savings and loans (VSLA) groups to enable them to purchase our filters. Each filter is sold to end users at $20, but given that this can still be a cost barrier to households in rural areas, SPOUTS is partnering up with small local organizations and the VSLAs in their target areas to offer financing options to women interested in purchasing filters. Most often than not, VSLAs are already comprised of women who participate in group-savings projects. It is through these pre-existing structures that SPOUTS will offer our products to in conjunction with educational trainings. _x000D_
First, SPOUTS will identify local partners who have a proven track record of working with women’s VSLAs. For example, a local partner that we work with has already trained 30 VSLAs on group dynamics, group saving and loan management and business skills. They have also trained these women groups on various income generating activities to increase their household income and social support. _x000D_
After identifying a local partner, we will provide the local partner with marketing materials, storage space and one truckload of filters (160 filters) in addition to some operating funds to cover expenses. This local partner will then reach out to district leaders to inform them about the product and offer group trainings to the different VSLA groups on clean water and the efficacy of our filters. The filters will then be offered to the VSLAs through group loans at no initial cost, and a credit finance officer from the local partner will receive monthly payments for the cost of the filters. This will allow for a revolving door fund to be created, allowing the local partner to continuously purchase our filters even after the initial 160 are sold. The attached budget outlines the cost-sharing between the local partner and SPOUTS after the initial 160 filters are sold. This will ensure that (1) the maximum amount of good comes out of an initial seed money of $25,000 and that (2) the local partner is also able to gain autonomy over their projects. _x000D_
The $25,000 will provide for five (5) new local partnerships to be created, distributing 800 filters to end-users in the first 3 months. The funds will be recycled every 4-6 months, creating a chain of change in these areas. Not only would the funds directly impact women’s abilities to purchase filters, drink clean water and gain independence from constantly having to boil water, the entire households would benefit from the clean water that is supplied. Households will be able to take responsibility over their clean water access.  _x000D_
","SPOUTS is an attempt to provide Ugandans with access to clean drinking water, to empower women through new opportunities for employment and education with the newly gained autonomy and to create a market-driven solution that is long-lasting. By the end of 2015, SPOUTS will provide more than 800 households with access to clean drinking water, freeing up the females of these households to devote their times to other activities. These water filters will be sold through Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) groups that are comprised of women in rural areas of Uganda. The filters will be sold to women on credit, allowing payback periods that extend up to 6 months with low interest rates. Women will have more time to earn additional incomes, and young girls will be able to devote more of their time to their studies. With the funds that are returned for the filters over a period of 6 months, more filters can be sold to end-users through a revolving door fund. _x000D_
","More than 30% of Ugandans, or 10 million people, lack access to clean drinking water. And water-borne illnesses remain the number one cause of death for children under the age of five. And these are merely the direct health results of lack of clean drinking water and doesn’t take into consideration (1) the economic costs of diarrheal diseases, (2) the opportunity cost for the time it takes to fetch and boil water and (3) the burden of fetching and boiling water that disproportionately falls on women and children.  It is estimated that women and children spend 140 million hours every day collecting water and account for 76% of the water collection for households (WHO/UNICEF). It is undeniable that many organizations are attempting to rectify this problem. However, solutions based on free distribution and/or large-scale community-based installations are often short-sighted and result in technologies that are left in disrepair. Individuals are left dependent on institutions.

2015,300,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,,Golden Bridge – Bridging hope for the future of the children,Hoshizora Foundation (Yayasan Bintang Langit),Indonesia,Indonesia,0,,['Education'],"Facilitating a foster siblings program, which connects more than 530 sponsors to 832 impoverished  children not only financially but also motivationally, has been putting us on a challenge on handling the communication of our sponsors with our sponsored children. Not only sending donation, the sponsor also communicate with the children through letters and the children’s progress report. We need to send reports, letters to each sponsor, and vice versa. Our research shows that this positive interaction between sponsor and the children contributes much on the success of the children, along with the financial support itself. With growing number of sponsored children, we need to think of the use of technology and design to facilitate our program. Therefore, we would like to propose a Golden Bridge project, which will be able to bridge communication & coordination among our stakeholders in more effective and efficient way, and thus contribute to the improvement of education in Indonesia. Through this project, we plan to:1.	Build an Informatics & Computer Technology System (ICT System) and mobile apps, which enable our sponsors to check regular report and letter from their children, update the foundation’s information, confirming their donation and many other function. Not only between sponsor and the children, this ICT system will also bridge communication among our area coordinators, who need to send us the profile of our children, and regular reporting. It can be a communication center for all of our stakeholders, from our sponsors, children, area coordinators, volunteers, and the Hoshizora Foundation itself. It will also enable us organizing our financial record and report. In addition, it will enable public to sign up as a sponsor, and a child to request a support online, thus innovate our way to connect those who have and do not have. _x000D_
2.	Build a coordination design for bridging communication among coordinators in all over Indonesia. Having Indonesia as an archipelago, comprising thousands of islands, currently we have limitation on coordinating with our coordinators in many other different islands. It is also making so much differences, in which some areas have electricity, and some may not; some are very remote, and some are in the city, and other many cultural and education background differences. Therefore, it is very important to build a coordination design to ensure that we are working as a team, and moving to the same direction. The coordination design will include regular meeting and discussion, benchmarking as well as capacity building for our area coordinators._x000D_
We believe that the ICT system, mobile apps  as well as coordination design for our coordinators will build a golden bridge to connect those who have with those who do not have, and ease communication process of all stakeholders in Hoshizora Foundation. Finally, we believe that it will bring  a new hope for thousands of children in Indonesia, by providing them an education access and a motivation to have a dream and achieve it._x000D_
","By November 2015, we will finish the 1st phase development of our ICT system, while by May 2nd 2016, along with Indonesia Education day as well as the Hoshizora Foundation’s establishment day we will finish our final version of the ICT system and mobile apps. It will definitely mark the social innovation for our education. By May 2016, this system will accommodate support of 1000 impoverished children in Indonesia, and expect to grow to 1250 children at the end of December 2016.To support our growth, we plan to finalize our design for coordinating our area coordinators by December 2015, and execute it from January 2016. By August 2016, we plan to have as many as 35 area coordinators in all over Indonesia to assist 1250 children at the end of December 2016._x000D_
We expect that 1250 children that we support every year will continue to go to school at least until senior high school, and have a better future. We believe that their education will be a key to their economic  empowerment._x000D_
","This project will amazingly innovate our way on connecting those who have and do not have, thus solve an access of opportunity and education for impoverished children. It will innovate the way that public contribute to education by feeling so much easy to contribute and able to see how their contribution impact the children. In more details, this project will solve complexity of communication between sponsor to the children. If before we have to send our progress report one by one to each of our sponsor, by having the ICT system we will be able to send it automatically, and of course many other functions

This project will solve many of our manual works, which has possibility of human error, shorten necessary time to finish a task, and make our work more efficient. 

The coordination design for our coordinators solve communication limitation among Hoshizora Foundation and area coordinators due to far distance. Finally, it will solve our challenge to handle big number of sponsors.W1"

First, we’ll make the teaching materials about health with some experts and designers before February 2016. Then women in their 20s are trained to the teaching assistants until April. From June, the beginning of semester, main education program about sanitation and menstruation is started. Per a school, 300 female students of 2 schools will be educated throughout 20 times for 6 months. During this time, workshops will be held for 100 mothers of the students once a month.

(WHO, 2000). Burma’s society associates menstruation with uncleanliness and embarrassment. Moreover, almost all women are making their sanitary pads from used clothes, bed sheets, and towels. When asked why, most women express how hard it's to purchase disposable sanitary pads. Burmese women are forced not to speak out about menstruation. Menstruation can also be linked with mental health illness and other taboos within the culture.

To be clear, Burmese women need alternative pads that are affordable. If inexpensive, disposable, and biodegradable pads are designed and created, this would be a huge change for their daily routines. The education and making of pads will change the women’s lives and allow them to control their lives by themselves. If this issue is addressed, it could be a breakthrough for the women of Burma.

However, we are now faced with supply challenges because of limited production capacity and supply chain issues from partner community enterprises. The grant will be used to grow ANTHILL by (1) strengthening its core team and filling in the gaps in human resource and (2) by establishing ANTHILL’s School of Community and Cultural Entrepreneurship through a Community Based Enterprise Development approach. Courses on Cultural Appreciation, Business Management and Development, Handloom Master- Apprentice Training and Financial Literacy and Management will be rolled out to 100 women weavers and crafters so artisans will discover and maximize their fullest potential in growing their business. The continuing education will equip the artisans with skills to improve the quality of their weaves, have more efficient business operations and increase their membership to enable them to meet the growing demands of the market and allow them to expand to new ones. Our Community Livelihood Activator, alongside our Ecosystem Partners, will facilitate the implementation of the school curriculum and cascade the program among our three communities in different phases throughout a period of 1 year. The grant will fully support the funding needed for the personnel, coordination, training materials, mentorship, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, the funding would also be used to expand their business through skills training, Sewing Chamber Expansion, Advanced Weaving Technique Program, and slowly expanding sourcing and interventions to more weaving communities in the southern part of the Philippines. We see these activities as tools that will empower the women to further develop their designs skills and maximize the use of the traditional handloom weaving as a technology to increase their economic opportunities and in turn provide a better quality of life and a flourishing weaving culture. ","By December 2016, we aim to increase the business literacy, business development and management capacity of our direct partner urban, indigenous and rural community enterprises and have at least 50 graduates from ANTHILL’s School of Community and Cultural Entrepreneurship among women weavers and crafters. It is expected that through this training program, we will be able increase our younger generation of weavers and crafters by 20% who will then transition to becoming Master Weavers/Crafters. With a stronger ANTHILL team, we will be able to increase market access and in turn increase the monthly average income across all communities by 40% form Php 5000 (estimate) to Php 7,000. With increased production capacity, we also aim to increase the amount of upcycled scrap thread used in our weaves from a monthly average of 200 kilos to 400 kilos. ","The ANTHILL’s School of Community and Cultural Entrepreneurship aims to address cultural degradation with focus on cultural preservation and promotion of handloom weaving and handloom fabrics and indigenous crafts. There is a lack of cultural transmission of weaving skills and traditions among the younger generations. There is a poor sense of cultural identity among the younger generation of women that usually leads to urban migration and weak communal sprit. Furthermore, there is also a lack of infrastructure and systems, business knowledge and skills, and business ownership among community enterprises that do not facilitate sustainable livelihoods among the hand loom weaving and handicrafts sector. Handloom fabrics and handloom weaving are both undervalued materials and skills that are mostly used as upholstery materials and home accents that turn off people from wearing.

Through providing engaging and accurate health information that affirms girls’ voices and their rights, we will see a reduction in school absenteeism and greater matriculation into secondary school. A girl’s income is directly correlated with the amount of school she completes. Above all, our health comics, girls are getting the information they need, seek and deserve.

2015,294,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,,Women employment through different art styles practiced in Madhubani,NavPallav,India,India,0,,"['Education', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Madhubani is known for its painting called as mithila painting. It is traditional art form of painting which is being passed on from generations to generations. It was traditionally being used in painting on mud walls which was later being used on handmade paper because of the effort of William G. Archer during the earthquake in 1934. But this is being practiced in some limited areas. About 96 % population of Madhubani districts lives in rural areas of villages. Our aim is to make the painting and other art forms of Madhubani district as income source and base of livelihood. And, not only painting, there are other weaving and knitting techniques, which are being practiced by the women and girls of Madhubani that can be taken out as base of livelihood for them. Apart from this, several other techniques with the help of wood, bamboo, grass, waste plastic bags or other wastes like bottles is being used in making decorative arts that can be taken to national and international level market to make them employable and self reliant.With the help of technology, several workshops on wall paintings, decorative arts, printing techniques can be organized, in case the experts are not available locally. So, the workshop can be done with the help on internet. The experts of some techniques like block printing, fresco will communicate face to face to the trainee groups with the help of internet if they are not available in Madhubani or in Bihar. The training will be delivered Through Skype and video conferencing software with the help of projector. This technique will project their image on large screens and it will enhance access of each and every trainee to understand and acquire the art skills taught by experts. Several printing techniques need the use of computer and peripherals and it will also help in making that design on computer with the help of softwares. _x000D_
Our aim is to train around 500 poor and under privileged women and girls of six villages of Madhubani districts (at least 80 from each villages) - Mahrail, Harri, Jalsain, Barsam, Bhabham and Marukia in the first year of our project execution. They will be trained with the help of master craftsmen and experts in different techniques of painting from various institutes of Bihar and if needed from other parts of the country like Kolkata, Delhi and from the state where the experts of particular art styles will be available. Then, Navpallav will take them to various trade fairs and help them in creating stalls to sell their artworks at district, state and national level. So that they can have an idea of the quality they will have to improve to get better prices in market and they will get hands on marketability experience and skills in selling their artworks. As, there is a huge gap between the prices of artworks by NGOs, websites and brokers associated with selling of these artworks. Brokers have decreased the prices of artworks to an unacceptable level. Like in case of Saree painted with Madhubani Painting, NGOs associated with these artworks sell those Sarees in around 5000 rupees per piece, while the same saree is sold by few websites in around 7000 rupees per piece but with the help of broker; they all get it in only 1600 rupees per piece. As a result of this there is huge decline in artistic quality of sarees in the broker’s case. The process of painting a saree with Madhubani painting takes a long time around 2-3 months if made by single artist but they get minimum prices for their labor. We have consulted with few ecommerce websites dealing in selling these artworks. They agreed on selling the artworks according to price demand of artists. Our only concern is to produce painting/handicrafts according to the market demand in terms of quality and quantity. Navpallav will also consult with the painting and handicraft association regarding the selling of their artworks and get them registered with the association. Right now, the handicrafts association is lacking in providing products according to market demand. This will help the poor girls and women of the projected villages in getting self employed.","This project can give employment to approx 500 women and girls who are less privileged or under privileged in projected six villages of Madhubani district in the first year. And, then these will train another 500 in the next year with the help of Navpallav and handicrafts/painting experts. This process will continue consecutively. This will make the under privileged and poor women/girls self employed and self dependent.","The handicrafts association, NGOs working in painting/handicrafts and Self Help Groups are lacking in providing products according to market demand because of its practice to limited number of areas.Our aim is to equip the under privileged or poor section with the art skills and works that they enabled to earn substantial amount of money for supporting the basic family needs. This will help those under privileged women/girls to find out more art practices (either died or in a state of dying) that will help them in being self employed. This will also minimize the risk of extinction associated with art practices. This can also ensure that the skills can be learn locally and lead to self employment.

Being unemployed and working as a housewife, they sometimes face domestic violence, mostly in the form of verbal and psycho-social abuses. This project will help in empowering women economically and will get ride to them from domestic violence to self dependency and economic empowerment.WW"

The micro enterprise aims to train and employ rural women (Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, Scheduled castes and tribes) in a number of small scale businesses including a tailoring unit for the production of readymade clothing for sale inside Wayanad, conceptualizing, design and develop handicrafts and toys out of raw materials like bamboo, coconut leaf, etc. and a food processing unit which would process locally abundant seasonal fruits like jackfruit in to jams and pickles, preserve and market forest produces like honey and brand and market traditional medicines like hair oil. This would require facilitating the setup of self-help groups and producer companies in the Panchayat, customizing machines and identifying renewable energy technology options, training and skill development, establishing appropriate market linkages and rigorous branding and promotion of the enterprise. Appropriate tie ups are being identified including Wayanad Agricultural Marketing Society, SELCO Renewable Energy Technologies and Azim Premji University. All products would be strictly organic/nature friendly and processed using clean energy technologies._x000D_
_x000D_
Skill Development center: While in the initial year the skill development center would be run completely on funds, the idea is to support its activities in part or full from revenue generated from the micro enterprise from subsequent years.  _x000D_
The center will have three sessions running parallel. _x000D_
1.	Free coaching classes for graduate students (girls) belonging to the underprivileged communities for clearing central and state government job examinations and interviews_x000D_
2.	Free coaching classes for higher secondary and senior secondary students (boys and girls) of the employees of the micro enterprise to qualify examinations to undergraduate programmes conducted at the state and central level. _x000D_
3.	More dedicated long term plan to coach and mentor students from the class of six and help them choose and clear appropriate examinations and scholarships of a profession of their interest.  _x000D_
4.	Besides this, other activities of the center would include providing training to the rural women in a number of areas including renewable energy technologies, maintenance and operation of machinery, computer applications, internet, DTP, medical transcription, organic farming, English language and marketing skills for employment in the micro enterprise and improved prospects in the open market. _x000D_
","By the end of six months from the start of the project we expect to train and employ around 12 women in the micro enterprise. We expect to raise this number to 30 by August 2016. We also expect to train around another 30 rural women in skills like renewable energy technologies, marketing, English language and computer applications for prospective employment in the open market by August 2016. Besides this, by the end of the project we expect to coach around 20 graduate and senior secondary students to qualify various state and central government examinations (job and graduate admissions) and make them aware of their opportunities.  We also expect to enroll and begin intense coaching of 10 bright students from BPL families from the 6th std. ","Unemployment: There are around 100 tribal households in Thrissilerry. Most of these families survive on subsistence farming or as daily laborers.   A highly vulnerable weather, decreasing prices for agricultural goods have and lack of continuous daily wage work have put enormous pressure on their lives and livelihoods. Lack of Awareness/Skills: Even while around 20% vacancies are reserved for Scheduled castes and tribes in various state and central govt. jobs, and in entrance examinations for undergraduate programmes, these communities remain unaware, lack necessary skills and are exploited. 

Education: Many bright students belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) have no option but to opt out of schools after 12th std. or settle for a regular professional course because they lack financial resources for coaching classes, mentorship to crack competitive open market entrance tests or scholarships required to choose a field of their interest.

A Dare Women’s Foundation representative will be selected to travel to Bead For Life in Uganda to receive training on how to teach the Street Business School (SBS). Upon this representative’s return, s/he will teach entrepreneurship skills to approximately 24 women in Machame village. From this group, approximately 12 women will be selected and provided with the materials and capital to start their own reusable sanitary pads businesses. A quarter of these 12 will become feminine hygiene ambassadors who will sell reusable pads on commission, share extensive knowledge about menstrual hygiene management in schools to female students and their mothers, and offer abbreviated information when selling outside of schools. Each sewing machine will need an assembly line of 3 women and 1 feminine hygiene ambassador. Currently the Dare Women’s Foundation has 2 sewing machines, but with a portion of this money we can purchase 2 additional machines._x000D_
Each reusable pad is made from comfortable, absorbent fabric with a leak-proof liner and cotton wings, which fasten around underwear to hold the pad in place. Each pack will include a short flyer and abbreviated information from the seller about feminine hygiene and caring for the pads and will instruct women and girls to share what they have learned with 3 others. The pads are estimated to last 1-2 years and must be dried in the sun to kill the bacteria. A set of 6 pads (3 heavy, 2 medium, 1 light) costs approximately $1 USD. Seamstresses and feminine hygiene ambassadors will be provided with sufficient materials to produce and sell approximately 15,600 pads by February 2016, enough for 2,600 women._x000D_
_x000D_
Funding will also allow us to purchase materials needed to research and measure our outcomes and provide stipends to researchers. We will track the amount and successful price points of pad sets made and sold. Attendance and performance of 60 school students will be tracked in the Karanga school of Machame village both before and after the introduction of reusable pads and feminine hygiene training. Participants will also receive a pre and post wellbeing surveys and will track feedback in a journal. Pads for this school will be funded and provided for free for research purposes. _x000D_

Project money will also fund 2 Dare Women’s Foundation project members to travel to Tanzania from the United States for approximately 1 month to implement the project and work with founder Maggie Duncan Simbeye to create a sustainable business plan and track outcomes. Project implementation will be recorded through photography and video to use for marketing purposes via social media and news platforms both in Tanzania and the United States. The goal is to create reusable sanitary pads businesses that can be sustainably managed by Tanzanian women after the funding period. ","By mid-December 2015, 1 Dare Women’s Foundation representative from Tanzania will travel to Uganda to be trained as an SBS instructor by Bead For Life and begin teaching entrepreneurship skills to approximately 24 Tanzanian women, 12 of which will be selected to work together to start reusable pads micro-enterprises. Our team aims to travel to Tanzania Dec 10 - Jan 5, 2016, to conduct initial fieldwork. While receiving SBS training, we will provide this group with sewing machines and initial materials for their micro-enterprises by January 1, 2016. By February 2016, we aim to produce 15,600 pads, which is enough for 2,600 women, and we aim to provide feminine hygiene training in 2 schools. We will begin our research in the Karanga School by administering our pre-project wellbeing survey and providing the students with reusable pads to begin monitoring attendance. After the initial fieldwork completed by Feb 2016, we plan to produce approximately 300 pads per workday per sewing machine.","In Tanzania, current methods of menstrual protection consist of old rags from a fabric called Kanga and sometimes cornhusks, which both often lead to fungal infections and skin rashes, especially when women are conducting difficult manual labor. In addition to these health complications, it is challenging for females to attend school and work during menstruation. In sub-Saharan Africa, 57% of girls attend primary school, but only 17% attend secondary school, and girls miss approximately 40 days of school per year during menstruation. Unlike Kanga, our reusable pads are absorbent and leak proof. Women and girls stated that they would feel comfortable drying them outside in the sun because they are beautiful and are not rags like Kanga. These pads are affordable and eliminate the challenge of finding a location to purchase disposable pads each month. This project will create jobs for women and will empower females to attend work and school during menstruation.BI"

Menstrual Cups represent a re-usable, affordable, sanitary, and discreet form of Menstrual Health Management (MHM): odorless, stain and leak free, as well as being far more environmentally sustainable than disposable sanitary napkins. Furthermore, they go beyond the fundamental level of economic empowerment (education); they enforce a gender-equity based message that school is just as much for girls as it is for boys. It allows girls equal access to school attendance as boys by providing them with the tools to manage their menstruation safely and without shame or harassment. Menstrual Cups show girls that just because their bodies are more stigmatized than boys’, does not mean that they must be limited and punished for it. The long-term effects of educated girls are innumerable, and assuring their ability to attend school without limits is the first step towards true economic empowerment._x000D_
Using 3D printing technology, we will produce and distribute Menstrual Cups (MCs) to girls attending school in Zimbabwe. With the grant money, the project will be able to purchase the project necessities: a 3D printer and the addition necessary to print with silicone, medical grade silicone (used to make the cups), the Cup packaging, as well as production costs of menstruation-related educational materials to be distributed alongside the MCs. Some of the grant money will also be allocated to testing, producing and processing the MC prototypes, as well as ensuring their viability according to health standards. Additionally, the grant money will go towards the shipping costs of the printer and the installation fee for the silicone printing add on. _x000D_
_x000D_
Through AWIDE, we will designate a target number of girls attending several different schools in Zimbabwe. Working alongside the schools, we will distribute the MCs amongst the girls and assess whether ownership of the MCs improves attendance for girls during their menstrual periods. Additionally, we will establish safe spaces and designate specific teachers in the schools from whom girls can seek guidance with questions concerning MHM or any menstruation-related issues. Some of the grant money will go towards the production of the first 50 MCs, which will be distributed amongst the target group for assessment, as well as covering the administrative fees related to the identification and registration of the girls in the programme._x000D_
_x000D_
Subsequently, if the project is successful and there is an increased demand for the MCs, we will found the Menstrual Cup Initiative (MCI): designed to provide more girls and women with MCs whilst simultaneously allowing girls to generate revenue for themselves. The MCI would be a system that would allow girls in school to purchase MCs from the organization at a low price so they could sell them to other girls and women in their respective communities. This would represent an affordable, re-usable and environmentally sustainable MHM tool that would profit women and girls throughout the country. This initiative would be organized and run by AWIDE, in conjunction with any interested parties such as, but not limited to, health institutions, educational institutions, etc. _x000D_
","By May 2016, the project aims to reach a target group of 100 girls attending school. They will be provided with MCs accompanied by menstruation-related educational material, and will also benefit from the safe discussion spaces set up at their schools through AWIDE. This should drastically reduce the menstruation-related absences from school, and the creation of safe spaces should work towards dismantling stigmas or misinformation concerning menstrual periods. Additionally, the creation of MHM dialogue should increase demand for the MCs in communities, thereby allowing for the creation of the MCI. By the end of the grant period, girls pertaining to the target group should report fewer menstruation-related absences, higher levels of knowledge concerning MHM, and increased comfort level discussing or seeking guidance in and out of school. Ideally, these girls will represent the initial group of independent MC saleswomen in the MCI, and will do better in school overall.","3D printed MCs were conceived as a response to the problems caused by girls’ menstrual periods and their inability to practice safe MHM, and lack of access to sanitary products. Often, menstruation leads to girls missing school or excluding themselves from social situations for fear of shaming or harassment. Girls are often subject to cruelty from their peers due to staining, odors, leaks or stigmas surrounding menstruation. They also often lack proper sanitary equipment and menstruation-related knowledge and can suffer from infection, discomfort or even unplanned pregnancy as a result. Other times, they are unprepared for their menses with inadequate or unsanitary pad alternatives which leads to them leaving school. MCs will allow girls to deal with menstruation in a sanitary and discreet way, as it is a re-usable, odorless, and nonrestrictive MHM tool. With the MCs, girls will be able to attend school and participate in their daily lives without their menstrual periods interfering. WB"

Emphasis will be laid upon linking Information Technology skills of female students for brighter job prospects of girls as a result of the skills attained. The proposed action will also focus on computer teaching, learning and the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supported through 3G technology recently rolled out in Pakistan. On the other hand, apart from Tablet PCs for the classrooms, the two selected schools will be provided with fixed end desktop computers with all essential accessories including multimedia to improve school management and use the technological gadgets in co-curricular activities for the students and improved school management. The project will focus two secondary girls’ schools in district Loralai in the backward province of Balochistan in Pakistan. The project will use a three-prong strategy to implement its model i.e: _x000D_
1). Provide 10 tablets, 2 PCs, 2 Multimedia projectors and 10 erasable whiteboards, to each of the selected girls’ schools _x000D_
2). Select and train a cohort of 10 teachers on how to use the tablets in classrooms, interactive boards and audio visuals in classrooms _x000D_
3). Hire a master trainer to design a brisk syllabus for use of technology in classrooms and train the selected teachers. _x000D_
_x000D_
This model is aimed at improving the female students’ interest in the use of digital media, mobile devices and ICT. The selection of the model will also help contribute in the women economic empowerment because most of the jobs with female concentration require basic and/or advanced computer skills. Having command over the use of computers, women have brighter job prospects. If a female candidate is well versed in the use of technology, she has much greater chances of being hired with some female suitable jobs like teaching, banking, IT, NGO sector, program support and clerical jobs. Teachers and school management on the other hand can also benefit from the technology integration by improving their teaching techniques, improved classroom and school management, discourage cramming, and improve student evaluation, IT skills, visual quality of teaching material and finally getting good results for conceptual subjects especially sciences. The direct beneficiaries of the project are 10 selected female teachers and about 1200 to 1400 students of grades 1 to 10 (Age 4-18). _x000D_
_x000D_
The detail of the three main objectives of the project is given below:_x000D_
_x000D_
1.	Provision of tablets, erasable   whiteboards, PCs and multimedia projectors to each of the selected girls’ schools:_x000D_
 _x000D_
Despite the growing attention on the use of technologies in education, its use in schools and classrooms of Pakistan especially with girls has not grown to the extent that is required to keep pace with the developing trends in the field of technology, assisted teaching and learning. In spite of all this, many schools and teachers have shown that it is possible to accomplish great things with access to even a single computer or tablet in the classroom. The tablet in a classroom will help to develop life skills of the students through improved knowledge of ICT, reduce the digital divide based on gender discrimination and help support the learning of about 1200 to 1400 pupils in different grades of the carefully selected schools through a mapping. The mapping exercise will focus on the suitability of the school for the action, geographical location and consultation with the district education department for female schools. The use of personal computer one for each school with multimedia and other accessories will also contribute in the knowledge of teachers and support them in technology assisted teaching. Each one of the two schools will have a multimedia projector that allows teachers to share content using animation, audio, and video. Research shows that children find the multimedia content much more engaging, and pick up basic concepts much more quickly when exposed to content this way. Efforts will be made to encourage the school management for designating a separate room for the PC and its accessories to work as an audio visual club for the students to attend a single period in that club each day from every class supported by the teachers trained under the project in the beginning. On the other hand, the classrooms teaching and learning will be supplemented with the use of tablets during the lectures to the students. Educational applications and learning audio visuals will be provided with the PC and tablets to enhance reading and learning. Emphasis will be laid upon the utilization of free softwares, applications, online learning resources and free student comic books to name a few. The GSM tablets supporting 3G Network will be provided access to fast internet connectivity within the class for any internet related learning like online searching, maps, sketches, diagrams etc.  As a result of the project, the students' academic performance will be improved and the level of ICT skills will be augmented. The use and purpose of tablets and other equipment provided will be for achieving the below tasks but not limited to it:_x000D_

2.	Select and train a cohort of 10 teachers on how to use the tablets in classrooms, erasable  boards and audio visuals in classrooms_x000D_
_x000D_
The “Train the Teacher” model will be employed through a tailor made refresher training of selected teachers from the two schools with specific emphasis on basic use of mobile devices like tablets in classrooms/schools, focus on advanced search techniques and develop a brief curriculum on how and what to teach to students on a daily basis. The training will also emphasis the various online free resources for learning, making online communication, use of social media, creative stuff, audio visual and interactive applications. The project aims to train 5 female teachers from each school (total 10) with the basic knowledge of how to use tablets and computers. These teachers will be trained by the hired master trainer according to the ToRs developed for the trainer. _x000D_
_x000D_
3. Hire a master trainer to design a brisk syllabus for use of technology in classrooms and train the selected teachers:_x000D_
_x000D_
Terms of Reference will be developed for a master trainer to develop a brief syllabus on how and what teachers will teach through these tablets and PC and how to assist the classroom teaching through these tablets. Specific emphasis would be made what activities to carry out with students in the class and in the audio visual club to help them utilize technology for getting education. A specific emphasis will also be laid upon encouraging students on how to use their family smart phones for taking assistance in their routine studies. During the trainings and under the ToRs, teachers will have sessions on advanced google search techniques and online English language learning resources via the internet to help children explore these two areas for their study. The overall objective is to provide trainee teachers a hands-on basic training of technology-aided teaching methods and enhancing their teaching lessons, reading, learning, erasable exercising, audio, video clips and improved understanding of digital, interactive and graphical interfaces. _x000D_

Project Management: _x000D_
The project will be managed through one Project Coordinator and one field-based ICT Assistants. A district based Project Launching ceremony will be held to apprise the relevant stakeholders about the purpose and objective of the project. Mapping of around 50 girls’ schools will be conducted to select the final 2 potential schools in close collaboration with the district education department. A master trainer will be hired to develop a brisk syllabus for the integration of technology in the classes and to train the teachers in light of the ToRs developed by YAD to help cater to the needs of how to properly provide them a refresher to meet the specific purpose. Quarterly revision, planning and follow up meetings will be held with teachers by the project staff. Quarterly progress sharing, consultation meetings with education department and stakeholders will also be held. A final experience sharing and exposure visit for selected students accompanied by two teachers to the provincial capital to a private school already implementing technology integration at the school or classroom level. A district based closeout meeting will also be held at the end of the project to reflect upon the success and lessons learnt of the project. ","The specific results of the project are as under:1). Provide 10 tablets, 2 PCs, 2 Multimedia projectors and 10 erasable whiteboards, to each of the selected girls’ schools _x000D_
2). Select and train a cohort of 10 teachers on how to use the tablets in classrooms, interactive boards and audio visuals in classrooms _x000D_
3). Hire a master trainer to design a brisk syllabus for use of technology in classrooms and train the selected teachers. _x000D_
Apart from the above 3 results, the project will also be holding a project kick off seminar and closeout meetings. The involvement of the school management and District Officer Education (female) will improve government’s involvement in the school. The provision of desktop with all accessories and multimedia will help to improve the school management and result in increase of co-curricular activities. _x000D_
","Balochistan is one of the least developed provinces of Pakistan. With the lack of provincial government resources and poor governance, it is lagging behind in education and economic empowerment for women. The female literacy rate in rural areas is less than a mere 2% and 70% of the girls drop out of school before completing their secondary education. This leaves the women with no prospects of job because most of the jobs appropriate for women like teaching, banking, information technology, NGO jobs, clerical and program support jobs all require basic or even advance use of technology and computers. It is a popular soundbite in the job industry of Pakistan that a person having no knowledge of a computer is simply illiterate. Above all, there is no specific government plan or proper intention for rolling out technology in the schools in future. This problem is further aggravated with girls particularly barred from schools due to economic, religious and cultural reasons.1T"

","Challenges Women in semi-arid parts of Kenya face significant challenges with majority being single mums and illiterate thus struggle to maintain a household and therefore some engage in prostitution while others tend to get married at a younger age so as to run away from their current problems not aware they are getting themselves in bigger problems since there they don’t have a voice hence physically or emotionally abused.  Also they have few or no opportunity to learn new skill since we don’t have free vocation trainings around and thus majority don’t have ways to earn income, thus raising school fee for their children become a problem. Also being in a semi-arid area it becomes hard to get food from their farms with majority sleeping hungry and thus relies on well-wishers and the government for food donations.   

Therefore, unless we need to train and equip these women with new business skills and improved agriculture that can fit in dry areas.S	"

","The main goal of the centre is to offer refuge to girls and women who don't wish to undergo fgm and teach them to be self reliant. Most girls in the community undergo the practice and it poses health problem to them. Also as a result they drop out of school due to early marriages after the circumcision. This is done when they are bery young as early as upto 7 yrears old. The woman is therefore an object of sexual abuse and women and children rights are violated in the process. It is compulsory and one is considered an outcast if they fail to undergo the process.

According to Kisoro District Report, 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, Kisoro Town Council has an estimated total population of 287,179 people. Kisoro town council is semi urban with trading potential due to its proximity with the boarders of Rwanda and Congo.  Kisoro is faced with influx of refugees from the war torn area of eastern Democratic republic of Congo.   Kisoro district faces traditional and cultural practices that fuels gender discrimination where much value is attached onto boy child than girls; this is because there are high rates of illiteracy making women and girls much vulnerable hence limited access to best opportunities for livelihood.  There is a high rate of unemployment that accounts for 70% in the district. As a result most girls have indulged themselves to commercial sex work activities for survival. Worse still some have ended up producing children without proper ways of caring for them. With high levels of poverty and illiteracy women have become victims of gender based violence because they fully depend on men for economic survival and are therefore seen as non contributors economically to most of the households. It is upon this background that Future hope foundation Uganda   is requesting for USD 25,000 to support 50 women /girls engaged in craft making business between ages of 18-35 years with adequate skills and knowledge in quality craft making for sustainable livelihood in kisoro town council. The project will be implemented in a period of 12 months starting from February 2016- February 2017.   The grant will help to equip 50 women/girls with adequate skills through trainings in key areas of quality production, marketing, record keeping, storage, savings and credit, Gender/HIV&AIDS/Human rights among others. This will enable them produce quality craft products able to fetch good market prices locally and internationally leading to business expansion and economic growth for women.  The 50 trained and supported women will further transfer skills to more 500 women/girls in the community for enterprise development, on estimate each woman will have trained 10 more women by the end of February 2017._x000D_

1. To equip women/girls with business skills that could lead to economic independence hence able to supplement household income for sustainable development._x000D_
 2. To create a platform where women are empowered with knowledge to advocate for social change by actively participating in community decision making processes.","The project will ensure 50 women/girls are equipped with adequate skills for quality craft production by the end of the January 2017.By February 2017, 5 saving groups comprising of 10 women in each group will be formed enabling 50 women to save money weekly basis which will reduce over dependency on men able to supplement household income._x000D_

2015,279,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,,Developing a Mobile Platform to Deliver Community-Demanded Content for Women,Dimagi Software Innovations,India,India,0,,"['Education', 'Science & Technology', 'Health', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","With support from Project Inspire, Dimagi proposes to create and deploy interactive content in a mobile platform called CommCare containing a wide range of information on health, empowerment and entrepreneurship and other themes demanded by women in rural India. The content in these “Social Apps” will be co-created with communities and distributed on tablets or android phones by community members. The apps will be designed to include elements of gamification and behavioral science in order to influence adoption of better health practices and improve knowledge informed by analytics on how behaviors change after ongoing use. New content will be introduced to users entirely based on user demand. _x000D_
This proposal focuses on integrating the latest behavior change approaches with a service delivery platform to create a radically new platform for widespread impact on maternal and newborn health. Women in India currently are offered an abundance of information promoting healthy practices, ongoing adult learning or entrepreneurial skill building. Dimagi and partners propose to create and test a novel platform for delivering content in its most compelling and persuasive way, adhering to the following two principles:_x000D_
1.	The content must be demand driven. Our proposed platform allows us to track which content is used, how often, and by how many women. Women must “pull” the content by selecting it rather than having it pushed onto them. _x000D_
2.	The content must be delivered through a variety of local change agents. Many of the women who need the content the most are low-literate, live in low-connectivity areas, and do not have their own access to the internet or other media channels. Our platform and approach will enable a wide variety of local change agents (LCAs), such as school teachers, shop keepers, peer educators, health workers, and coordinators of womens’ groups and agricultural cooperatives with a tablet-based tool for facilitating learning in their communities. We believe that most communities have local champions who will help spread critical, demand driven information. _x000D_
_x000D_
Dimagi will partner with a number of existing partners in India to co-create 10 new applications covering a range of issues. Social Apps would be developed with communities in Hindi.  Social Apps will be distributed to 100 LCAs in communities in India. Once deployed, the usage of the applications will be monitored in real time. We will apply data from our analytics to program more interactivity into Social Apps– to make them more “sticky” – in order to influence behaviors that lead to saving lives of mother and children. We will invest energy in the development of our digital content libraries based on where we observe efficacy for adoption and behavior change. _x000D_
_x000D_
","Between December 2015 and March 2016, Dimagi will develop 10 additional Social Apps representing a wide range of content demanded by women in communities. Content suggestions will be gathered from focus group discussions and verified via field testing. Dimagi will work with communities to develop content for Social Apps using methods such as story boarding, group activities, role-plays and workshops. Dimagi will reach out to content providers in India to supplement content requirements for the Social Apps during this time as well. In April and May, Dimagi will prepare the quantitative and qualitative tools and refine the metrics for Social Apps evaluation. By June, we will launch these apps to 100 local change agents at a rural site in India. These applications will be tested for at least 3 months in the field until August. In August and September, Dimagi will investigate usage data and propose iterations. By December 2016, we intend to publish our findings.","Access to content for hard to reach communities, specifically women in these communities is broken, incomplete and often does not reach the people that need it the most. This innovation leverages the CommCare platform to create avenues for new and existing users to gain knowledge on topics they decide and make it available through a technology medium that is slowly diffusing to women and girls.In recent years, there has been a surge mobile technology initiatives to address a wide range of development issues. However the majority of this has been top-down and pushed to communities. The content in the Social App responds to the needs identified by these people not just those needs dictated from the top-down.

Finally, Social Apps includes content horizontally across different areas, including but not limited to health. Too often projects are developed in a silo covering only selected information, when in reality there are many issues of importance to women in hard to reach communities.

2015,277,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,,Women employment through different art styles practiced in Madhubani,NavPallav,India,India,0,,"['Education', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Madhubani is known for its painting called as mithila painting. It is traditional art form of painting which is being passed on from generations to generations. It was traditionally being used in painting on mud walls which was later being used on handmade paper because of the effort of William G. Archer during the earthquake in 1934. But this is being practiced in some limited areas. About 96 % population of Madhubani districts lives in rural areas of villages. Our aim is to make the painting and other art forms of Madhubani district as income source and base of livelihood. And, not only painting, there are other weaving and knitting techniques, which are being practiced by the women and girls of Madhubani that can be taken out as base of livelihood for them. Apart from this, several other techniques with the help of wood, bamboo, grass, waste plastic bags or other wastes like bottles is being used in making decorative arts that can be taken to national and international level market to make them employable and self reliant.With the help of technology, several workshops on wall paintings, decorative arts, printing techniques can be organized, in case the experts are not available locally. So, the workshop can be done with the help on internet. The experts of some techniques like block printing, fresco will communicate face to face to the trainee groups with the help of internet if they are not available in Madhubani or in Bihar. The training will be delivered Through Skype and video conferencing software with the help of projector. This technique will project their image on large screens and it will enhance access of each and every trainee to understand and acquire the art skills taught by experts. Several printing techniques need the use of computer and peripherals and it will also help in making that design on computer with the help of softwares. _x000D_
Our aim is to train around 500 poor and under privileged women and girls of six villages of Madhubani districts (at least 80 from each villages) - Mahrail, Harri, Jalsain, Barsam, Bhabham and Marukia in the first year of our project execution. They will be trained with the help of master craftsmen and experts in different techniques of painting from various institutes of Bihar and if needed from other parts of the country like Kolkata, Delhi and from the state where the experts of particular art styles will be available. Then, Navpallav will take them to various trade fairs and help them in creating stalls to sell their artworks at district, state and national level. So that they can have an idea of the quality they will have to improve to get better prices in market and they will get hands on marketability experience and skills in selling their artworks. As, there is a huge gap between the prices of artworks by NGOs, websites and brokers associated with selling of these artworks. Brokers have decreased the prices of artworks to an unacceptable level. Like in case of Saree painted with Madhubani Painting, NGOs associated with these artworks sell those Sarees in around 5000 rupees per piece, while the same saree is sold by few websites in around 7000 rupees per piece but with the help of broker; they all get it in only 1600 rupees per piece. As a result of this there is huge decline in artistic quality of sarees in the broker’s case. The process of painting a saree with Madhubani painting takes a long time around 2-3 months if made by single artist but they get minimum prices for their labor. We have consulted with few ecommerce websites dealing in selling these artworks. They agreed on selling the artworks according to price demand of artists. Our only concern is to produce painting/handicrafts according to the market demand in terms of quality and quantity. Navpallav will also consult with the painting and handicraft association regarding the selling of their artworks and get them registered with the association. Right now, the handicrafts association is lacking in providing products according to market demand. This will help the poor girls and women of the projected villages in getting self employed._x000D_
","This project can give employment to approx 500 women and girls who are less privileged or un-privileged in projected six villages of Madhubani district in the first year. And, then these will train another 500 in the next year with the help of Navpallav and handicrafts/painting experts. This process will continue consecutively. This will make the un-privileged and poor women/girls self employed and self dependent.","Different art techniques are being practiced in various villages of Madhubani for so many years and these techniques are being transferred from generations to generations to their successors. But these art practices are not being used for commercial purposes even in the pathetic state of unemployment in Madhubani. These all techniques are being practiced by women and girls of Madhubani. Since, most of the families in villages are farmers; these artworks can be helpful in being a source of income and a base for livelihood. But they are unaware of the fact that these art practices in making artworks can make them self employed. Even, not having the knowledge of various schemes provided by state and central government for welfare of artists and artworks/handicrafts lead to the unimportance of these artworks. The handicrafts association, different NGOs working in painting and handicrafts and other Self Help Groups are lacking in providing products according to market demand.WW"

In executing these projects, it is hoped that each student reaches out to another 10 students, and continues to educate one another in the power of transmedia outreach, thereby creating a butterfly effect. At the end of the programme, 100 students are potentially more adept in transmedia skills to help convey their causes in more meaningful and effective ways, reaching the widest possible awareness, causing the most impactful action to be taken.","There is a lack of awareness in many underlying societal problems lurking in third world Southeast Asian countries that should be brought to attention. Examples of such problems that beg for attention are the underhanded abuse and trafficking of women and children across countries, unequal treatment of females in a backward social system, controversial or taboo implementations within the community, and many more. This project hopefully empowers the girls and students to take matters into their own hands and use the power of transmedia to convey their plights and causes, rendering change and action region-wide.FT"

Funds from Project Inspire would allow us to invest in more efficient large-scale manufacturing and distribution, hire local teams to ensure sustainable growth, and continue to improve our technology. In particular, we will be able to bring on staff with more experience in clean water programs who can help us emphasize this element of our work, as our current team is most skilled in solar energy. As our technology matures and we develop new products, the prize will also allow us to invest in the marketing materials and strategy needed to ensure a successful launch. Lastly, guidance from Project Inspire mentors would be tremendously valuable in helping us evolve our strategy._x000D_
For end users, the SunSaluter reduces the cost of solar energy by 15-20%, making it easier to transition to renewable energy and eliminate dangerous and expensive kerosene gas. It also produces four liters of clean drinking water every day, ameliorating the burden of waterborne illness. For partner organizations and entrepreneurs, the SunSaluter creates new revenue streams and livelihood opportunities. Organizations can use it to make sales to new and existing customers, and entrepreneurs can build entirely new businesses manufacturing and distributing SunSaluters in their region. This way, the SunSaluter becomes an integral part of their livelihood, community, and renewable energy future._x000D_

Working closely with end users from 130 deployments in 16 countries, we have finally created a viable product, and are now ready to scale operations worldwide. With our product market-ready, building a sustainable business structure around the SunSaluter is our primary challenge. There is tremendous interest from customers and potential partners around the world, but we do not yet have a robust enough manufacturing and distribution system in place to meet the need. We must invest in large-scale manufacturing to drive down costs and make the SunSaluter under $10 for the consumer, continue with the development of larger systems, and hire the staff needed to move the organization forward sustainably. In essence, SunSaluter’s greatest need is capital to scale. The award from Project Inspire would impact our organization substantially._x000D_

For the environment, each SunSaluter reduces three tons of CO2 emissions per year. 6.6 million SunSaluters are needed to save 20 million CO2 emissions per year. ","1.5 billion people live without electricity - 400 million in India alone. Without light at night, families turn to dangerous and expensive kerosene lanterns, their working hours are restricted, and children cannot study. Furthermore, many of these individuals are also among the 750 million people worldwide who lack access to clean water. Solar energy is a proven solution for alleviating energy poverty in the developing world, but it is often still too expensive for poor, rural consumers. Furthermore, solar panel rotators are virtually never used in remote, off-grid settings due to their high cost and tendency to malfunction. Our product, the SunSaluter, is the only solar tracker designed for the developing world. Using just gravity and water, the SunSaluter boosts solar panel output by 30% and reduces total system costs by 15-20%.

The communities at the lakes are mainly dominated by youth who depend on fishing for their income and food security.  It is uncommon to find women in these communities at sea fishing due to the laborious nature of the work involved and the associated risks. Therefore most women resort to hiring men to go out to sea to catch fish for sell on their behalf while others engage in micro businesses like fish mongering,  smoking and frying. Moreover, the number of unemployed women in fishing communities is alarmingly high because they are characterised  by; low levels of education where a few of them complete primary school and fewer transition to secondary school , teenage pregnancy, lack of skills, remoteness, marginalisation from government development initiatives and lack of infrastructure.100 young women living along the shores of Lake Victoria and the nearby islands in Jinja district will be trained on how they can use lake based cages to successfully rear fish for income generation.  The training will equip the women on setting up of fish cages, hatching fish, feeding them, treating them, making fish feeds and joint marketing to achieve economies of scale in the fishing business. The project will set up 10 demonstration cages which will be used by the women to practice fish cage rearing for one cycle, which takes 8 to 12 months for the fish to mature for sale. After every cycle, a new batch of young women will be recruited for training and supported to practice lake based fish cage farming using the same demonstration cages while those who will have been weaned off will be ready to create their own fish cages, hence creating a multiplier effect._x000D_
Water bodies in Uganda are plagued with destructive fishing methods, over fishing, and environmental degradation which threatens marine life and consequently has forced the government of Uganda to put stringent restrictions to fishing activities in water bodies._x000D_
Lake based cages as a technology requires less labour, takes less money and the technology is easily replicable. The technology also enables one to rear comparatively more fish and the quality of the yields is better because the fresh water of the lake is a natural habitat for the fish, providing good quality abundant water. An example of what Ugandan shillings 5 million (about USD 1500) can do compared to putting the same amount in ponds or tanks;_x000D_
You can raise a cage of 1,025 cubic metres, which will accommodate atleast 5,000 fish, yielding 105,050 kilos. Using the same Shs5m for a pond, it will give you a pond of 600 cubic metres, which will hold about 1,800 fish. If you devote the Shs 5m to tanks, it will give you three tanks of the type that can hold 900 fish each, giving you a total of 2,700 fish_x000D_
","By December 2016, 100 out of school, unemployed young women aged 18 to 25 years living in fishing communities in Eastern Uganda will be skilled in lake based fish cage farming. It is expected that after a 12 months cycle of practicing fish cage farming in the demonstration cages, they will be well equipped  to set up lake cages for fish farming cages.",creating employment for out of school young women living in fishing villages1•
2015,272,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,IN,India,,Kartavya,Kartavya,India,India,0,,['Education'],"As our source of funding isn’t enough or reliable for our project/mission. we are going to spend money on school fees, books, women empowerment mission (Saheli), health camps, center management, recruiters etc.1.       School fees: We provide schooling to those children whose parents can’t make enough money to provide education to their children. These students are selected on the basis of their parent’s annual income from all the sources. We try hard to get benefits from government schemes for poor children’s education but as they are living in temporary arrangements, they can’t benefit from them. Some of the students do get these benefits so we don’t have to pay for them._x000D_
2.       Books: Some or we should say all the parents whose children are studying in our centers can’t afford books for their child, so we provide them books from our library._x000D_
3.       Saheli: 'Saheli' is the project of Rotary Club, Dhanbad extended to Kartavya Chapter. It aims to train women of underprivileged section in areas like sewing, hand knitting, painting etc. to enhance their socio-economic status. Rotary club has given financial aids for this project. Computers and sewing machines have been donated to Kartavya Saheli Center by Rotary club. In short span it has covered about 30 women under its roof and is proving beneficial to them._x000D_
	Now we are planning to extend this project, we are aiming towards providing training and then employment to most of the women whose children are in Kartavya and a once it is done we can bring it to other women also. Also, we are planning to use internet to facilitate this change. We are planning to get in touch with professionals, social workers around the world who can help the women learn the various art according to their interest. Once this is done we hope to see the people prosper in their life without any external help. _x000D_
4.       Health Camps: We are organizing health camps in every Basti (Slum areas) every week to eliminate health related problems in families living there. As they are living underprivileged, they contract diseases frequently due to cleanliness or malnutrition. _x000D_
5.       Center management: We usually have 3-4 centers in a close periphery to college situated into those slum areas. We rent a building and a caretaker and then we perform survey for admission into that center. In ISM DHANBAD KARTAVYA chapter we currently have 4 centers in college periphery._x000D_
6.       Recruiters: Whenever college volunteers have vacations or exams, to maintain the regularity of students we hire female recruiters (usually poor) from other colleges to teach and take care of the centers._x000D_
All of the points discussed above requires money and dedication for smooth working of this project. College students are very dedicated to this mission.   _x000D_
","As Kartavya is now a well-established and famous NGO, major goals can be realized. Since its inception, Kartavya has increased to 11 centers across India. Kartavya is providing employment to 50+ people through recruitment. Vocational training currently provides training to about 150 people, and in women empowerment, currently 65 women are being taught.But this is not enough for complete betterment of society. We are aiming towards increasing number of students in each centers and opening Kartavya chapters in every major college in India. We have a target to educate every slum children living in slum areas nearby college campuses. Also, we plan to make “Saheli” a major project in which we are going to give training to each women whose child is studying in Kartvaya. By the end of this year, we are hoping to provide employment to at least 100 women and increase number of students to 1500.","Literacy of slum children: We provide the kids admission, books, school dresses and transportation expenses so that they attend their classes regularly. Evening tuitions and library classes are provided at Kartavya centers to supplement their school study.Health issues of people: Often people living in slums are either malnourished or diseased, so to provide health tips and medicines, we organize health camps every month.

Domestic violence and drug abuse: We have been trying to fight this and its causes with help of police department, by shifting the alcohol shops away from the locality, making women aware about their rights so that they can voice themselves. 

Child labour: Some slum children have to work and some go to work on their own wish to help their family. We engage them in school which has a long term benefit.

Child marriage: We provide counselling to parents and try to loosen the shackles of child marriage, specially for girls who are married at a very tender age.

2015,271,AU,Australia,IN,India,AU,Australia,AU,Australia,,The Fabric Social Inspire Program,The Fabric Social Australia,Australia,Australia,0,,['Entrepreneurship & Business'],"Falling between the cultural tropes of South Asia and South East Asia, the Northeast region struggles to maintain the identity of its multitudinous tribal identities while simultaneously struggling to reap any benefits from conforming with ‘mainland’ Indian culture. Most young educated Northeasterners move to India’s major capitals, for education and employment, feeling that local industries are ineffective, inefficient, or just plain corrupt. This greatly damages opportunity for business development, entrepreneurship and social mobility more generally. _x000D_
Some financial faith in traditional cottage industries, such as silk rearing and weaving would go a long way towards rebuilding these communities that live under the shadow of conflict and poverty. Our khadi and silk weavers in Assam have been creating beautiful, sustainable fabrics for generations. They create peace silk, which doesn’t kill the silk worm or moth as part of the process. They create khadi, a sustainable cotton that is the symbol of Indian independence. Their fabrics are naturally organic and the workshops operate in a co-op style fashion, with in-built community support systems. _x000D_
_x000D_
Over the past 18 months, we have implemented demonstrable financial traction and substantial social impact in Lakwa. With all this groundwork in place, we feel we have created a replicable and scalable model. The world is ready for The Fabric Social. _x000D_
_x000D_
Many organisations have reached out to us asking to collaborate, both in India and around the world. We are seeking funding in order to start small and smart, by expanding to two new villages in Assam - one in the Sivsagar cluster where we currently work, and another in the Bodoland Territorial Council Districts. Both of these communities are conflict-affected weaving villages, with workshops run by and for women. _x000D_
_x000D_
By replicating our participatory, technology driven approach, we can generate income for women in these new communities. _x000D_
_x000D_
We will spend the $25,000 to:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. Bring two new villages into The Fabric Social community of weavers. This will involve relationship building, consultation and training. We like to build intensive relationships with our weavers and create solidarity over many months of personal interaction and trust building. Our communities should feel they have ownership over The Fabric Social as equal participants. They work for themselves, not for us. _x000D_
_x000D_
2. Purchase second hand iPhones and iPads, so that we can implement our app. The Fabric Social app is developed by the CodeCloud education platform, who uses us as an example project for their aspiring software engineers to practice their skills. This is a longitudinal aspect of our project, developed over time and in close consultation with our weavers. This will allow for the women to track their production, track their income, keep on top of quality control and to communicate with us at any time. It is vital to the sustainability of this project, which works with geographically and socially isolated communities. It also eliminates the risk of funds pooling with one person or one set of people, and ensures transparency in workloads and payment. _x000D_
_x000D_
3. Establish SHGs (self-help groups) in the new villages. The National Rural Livelihood Mission program supports women’s groups who have proven that they can save funding together as a group. This can be as little as 100 rupees per week over six months, which is then matched by the Indian government. Pooling community funding shows commitment to the group as a whole and can allow for future planning of larger purchases, such as dyeing equipment, bicycles, loom construction and weaving training. _x000D_
_x000D_
4. Purchase and distribute solar lamps and chargers from Illumination Solar, to overcome electricity scarcity. We have built a relationship with Illumination, who donated 20 lamps to our pilot project. The lamps mean that the weavers can work at any time of their choosing. It has the added benefit of reducing the hazardous use of kerosene lamps in the home, of allowing children to do homework at night and providing added security when moving around the village in the dark. The solar chargers mean that the women can continue using the smartphone app, even without electricity. _x000D_
_x000D_
5. Invest in commissioning new clothing designs, and in advertising these to the Australian market. This involves prototype development, product development, fabric testing, stress testing and dye development. Each new village will have different skill sets and strengths to which the project should be tailored. We never tell our weavers what they should do, we work with existing talent on the ground. This means our fabrics and designs will not always work in every village, and that product development starts afresh in new contexts. _x000D_
_x000D_
6. Train and hire a new local manager to support the project into independence. Our product development, managerial and monitoring and evaluation staff are all volunteers from Australia, which is not a sustainable model. We would prefer to promote from within local communities and foster business development and entrepreneurship on the ground. _x000D_
_x000D_
7. Establish a Girls Activity Group. This process has been successful in our existing project in Lakwa, where conflict-affected teens and girls feel left out of the project, but want to get involved. Our Co-Founder Sharna has extensive experience working with young people in vulnerable communities, creating activity groups, and in turn creating a safe space to express themselves._x000D_
_x000D_
8. Invest in participatory monitoring and evaluation. A fantastic consultant in Australia, who has volunteered their time to the project, has undertaken our M&E process. We would like for this to continue and to expand to the new communities, so that there can be a broader understanding, data collection, community consultation and cross-village comparison of our assumptions. This will only strengthen the project._x000D_

6. By May 2016 : distribute 8 smartphones to these new locations._x000D_
7. By July 2016 : establish 3 self-help groups (one in our existing village and one in each new village) in accordance with the NRLM guidelines._x000D_
8. By July 2016 : establish 3 Girls Groups._x000D_
9. By August 2016 : 3rd M&E report published. _x000D_
10. By September 2016 : developed and tested three new clothing designs (Spring 2016). _x000D_
11. In October 2016 : advertising and social media campaign to promote the Spring collection. _x000D_
12. By December : (at least) double the daily income of 20 khadi weavers and 20 silk weavers. ","Poverty is one of the greatest causes of conflict and conflict is one of the greatest causes of poverty. This protracted cycle of armed insurgency has played out this narrative in India’s Northeast region for over half a century. Development funding seldom reaches beyond the Siliguri Corridor, and many industries consider the area to be too high risk.

There is certainly no lack of skills in these villages - who have been creating beautiful, sustainable fabrics for generations. What is lacking is market opportunity, a link to the outside world where there is both the demand, and the expendable income to purchase these products. We are determined to build this link, both for the benefit of these communities, and so that consumers in the western world can share in these grassroots stories and feel that they are part of the solution; that their purchasing power is political power.

In the Gomoa West District alone, 762 teenage pregnancies were recorded within the year with 17 out of the number being between the ages of 10 and 14.The increasing incidence of teenage pregnancy in the Central Region and the Gomoa West District in particular has become a source of great concern for opinion leaders, organizations and parents who are especially saddled with the burden of having to care for their “Children and their babies”. _x000D_
Empowering Teenage Mothers for the Future Project therefore seeks to manage the consequences of teenage pregnancy by creating opportunities for teenage mothers to restructure their lives by developing skills that will make them gainfully employed to support themselves and their babies. _x000D_
Empowerment of these Teenage Mothers will be done through sensitization, trainings/capacity building in skills like soap making and beads making.  The project will further provide parental counselling to guide them in their roles as young mothers._x000D_
This project recognizes the fact that the incidence of teenage pregnancy will persist if conscious efforts are not made to sensitize teenage girls on the dangers of early pregnancy. As a result the project will sensitize the youth in the district on the dangers of teenage pregnancy and provide reproductive health education for young girls especially in the Junior High School level to enlighten them on reproductive health issues. _x000D_
Empowering Teenage Mothers for the Future Project will target young mothers and girls between the ages of 10-25 years in three of the largest communities in the Gomoa West district specifically Apam, Ankamu and Mumford.

The next step for us is to reach out to credible Training Service Providers (TSP), all over Bangladesh and help them use the product to secure jobs for their low and semi-skilled trainees. We also have to reach out to industrial employers, mainly those in the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector and sell our product to them for a small fee. In addition to it all, we will partner with a non-profit called 'Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety', to ensure that those employers we partner with are compliant of labour laws of the country. In order to attain the goal of ensuring jobs for at least 500 women in the next 18 months, we need to hire 3 key people. _x000D_
Firstly, we need a Business Development Manager to market the product to potential new partners (Training Providers and Employers) and develop relationships with them to collaborate with us. In addition to that, we need a Communications Associate to maintain efficient and smooth inflow and outflow of information between the Training Providers, Trainedbd and Employers. This person will also be responsible for ensuring that input of worker information into the system is done  accurately and in a timely fashion. Lastly, we need a Database Manager to ensure the database functions effectively. _x000D_

Other expenses to run the project include transportation costs, marketing expenses, etc. We hope to recover these costs from fees paid by potential employers to have access to the database of worker profiles. ","By December 2016, we hope to ensure stable jobs for about 500 trained female workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Economic empowerment of these women and a higher income for the family can ensure education for their children, especially the girls, who often drop out of school to financially support their families. ","Almost a million trained low and semi-skilled Bangladeshi workers graduate from training institutes with some useful industrial skill every year. However, more than half a million fail to get jobs. They dedicate resources, especially time and money in acquiring these skills, but fail to secure stable employment. It is not a shortage of jobs that is the main problem, but the disconnect between labourers and potential employers. Trainedbd is a technological innovation that intends to bridge this information gap.It is an online database that can hold information on thousands of trained workers. 

Most of the skills provided pertain to the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) industry that employs around 4 million women. Therefore, about 70% of those who graduate from these institutes are women. We hope to facilitate job placements for at least a 1,000 of these trained women by 2018. We hope this number to double by 2020.WW"

","Governments try to ensure social equality but social equality does not mean equal career opportunities. Studies have shown that the current environment still promotes people from privileged backgrounds. The glass ceiling for women in leadership positions is known. But there are also glass ceilings for young people lacking certain social, economic, (inter)cultural and regional backgrounds. 

The historic Viennese salons can be compared to the elitist circles in business and politics today. However, hosted by aristocratic women, they were also used as a vehicle to break glass ceilings of that time, e.g. no right to vote for women. Similar to these salons, our project brings together people who would not have the remotest possibility to connect. Therefore, our online platform opens up an ‘elitist’ circle to less privileged people who otherwise would not have the remotest possibility to connect: we share insider knowledge to break social glass ceilings by using technology.

Seeing that it was helpful and with interest from other friends in the community, the force grew to five and today six because they wanted to benefit from my education as most of them are not educated or slightly educated. Today, they can boast of a small snail farm, a traditional oven and dryer and a restaurant after about 8 years of struggle. With increase activity, the founding members are willing to help their friends of the community whom are less better off as at now through integration in their social activity. $25000 will be used to acquire 1 hectares of farmland, construct 10 large free range pens and to integrate and train 19 more women of the community as an initial step.

With the construction of new snail farms, we will be able to store and preserve snails in a way that would reduce perishability, thereby reducing loss. We currently loss a lot of snails due to lack of good storage facility.Also, trade in snails is flourishing in Europe and North America. However, in spite of the considerable foreign and local demand, commercial snail farms such as those in Europe, South-East Asia and the Americas hardly exist in Cameroon. If we can be able to tap into international markets, surely our community and members can benefit from this.

Our aim is to directly impact the lives of 30 women during the life span of the project. The women will be taught the basic knowledge in sewing along with other specific skills and techniques related to sewing such as tye and dye techniques, traditional marking techniques, and fashion designing technical skills. This will go a long way to empower the women by encouraging their entrepreneurship skils and make them autonomous and active individuals in the countries economy. It will also help them achieve a sense of dignity and self-esteem.  In order to carry out this project, there is the need for finances to buttress the existing initiative.The $25,000 grant will be used judiciously in order to realize this project. Following the activities planned, the money will be used to carry out preliminary needs assessment. This consists of the venue for assessment, the identification of trainers, the drafting of training manuals, transportation and other administrative costs. We will also need to purchase tailoring equipment which consist of sewing machines, fabric, thread amongst others. This is important for the practical exercises. The money will equally be used for the preparation of training manuals and the implementation of the training sessions. These manuals will be drafted by those taking part in the training of the women. The training sessions will equally be done by the expert trainers in the various specialities which include sewing, tye and dye, embroidery, traditional marking on fabric and fashion designing. Training will be done for seven months from the month of March 2016 to October 2016.

The women will be trained by experts in these domains listed above. It is expected that all 30 women will open up small tailoring workshops or business that will in turn train other women in that light.Another alternative is pursueing further specialized education","Its without a doubt evident that a greater percentage of our woman in Cameroon today are less empowered as a result of either their low intellectual level or the fact that they lack certain skills which they could use to better themselves and their society. This gives rise to financial setbacks as poverty and illiteracy rate in our society is on the rise. Many do not have access to any training nor finances for education. This keeps them stagnant on the ladder of knowledge. As such, the employment rates tend to sky-rocket as malpractices proliferate. Ihis tailoring initiative is out to reduce the level of employment in our community, reduce poverty as women will be able to have a constant source of income. This project will also help build up their self-esteem as they become independent and self-sufficient. In addition, it will increase their literacy level in the aspect of design which is a core tool to empowerment hence improving their access to designing jobs and opportunities.AI"

Girl orphanages do not have a Business Model to effectively take care of children and they always depend on donations which at times do not reach them as expected.

PROBLEM2 : Every 30 minutes, a farmer is committing suicide in India due to improper crop yield, debts they have for cropping etc. The families after their death go through several difficulties, at times there are cases like whole family commit suicide. Natural causes though play a role in this but the chain involved in cropping has several commission layers in purchasing seeds to selling their yields to market. Though Government involves to certain extent, this problem remained an unsolved problem in the country. Very few NGOs deal with this problem and they are not financially well equipped to help farmers.

For generations, members of this community have been excluded from effectively participating in social and cultural life, economy, politics and decision-making processes. Their deprivations are grounded in non-recognition as a separate gendered human being beyond the male-female dichotomy. In addition to this, the fact that they express feminine traits, dress as women, adopt roles traditionally associated with women and inhabit women-centric economic spaces makes them victims of gender discrimination as well, leading to further exploitation.  This continued oppression, social exclusion and access to limited economic activities forms a vicious cycle which keeps these communities in systemic poverty. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our aim:_x000D_
Despite being substantial in numbers, members of this community, who for all practical purposes live as women, share equal apprehensions on breaking free from their currently defined occupational roles such as begging and sex work. Through our frequent engagements with the community members, we believe that the successful empowerment of an initial cohort of hijras will prove useful in inspiring the other members. The success of a small group in achieving an empowered status will lead to a trickle-down effect via which others in this community feel emboldened and confident to explore mainstream occupational roles, with or without external support._x000D_
_x000D_
The hijra community’s gradual foray into exploring conventional occupation opportunities will eventually directly and indirectly aid in lessening society’s apprehensions towards engaging with them and other marginalized minorities. It will also accelerate their mainstreaming, paving a path for younger members from this and other communities to more easily gain acceptance in society in the future._x000D_
_x000D_
About our project:_x000D_
Our project will happen in partnership with the Pahal Welfare Society based in East Delhi, which has been working with a community of 900 transgenders for over two years now. The project will seek to pave a path for this community’s social inclusion in mainstream society through their economic empowerment. _x000D_
_x000D_
Design: _x000D_
To transcend the challenge of mainstreaming a community which has been marginalized and exploited for generations, our project design will be built on enabling their economic empowerment and social inclusion via 3 Es: Education, Employment, Entrepreneurship. Rather than imposing an externally developed framework upon them, our project has been constructed in sync with a human rights approach, and the design comprehensively takes into account the ambitions, desires and opinions as expressed by the community members themselves. _x000D_
_x000D_
Brief Design Description and outcomes:_x000D_
i.	25  hijras will be identified and selected on the basis of a structured selection framework designed by us, to participate in our project on ‘Employability and Dignity – Mainstreaming the transgender community in India’;_x000D_
ii.	Based on their interests and aspirations, they will be free to choose between the 3Es of Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship, all of which may be considered to be the most crucial elements in any sustainable economic upliftment and empowerment process._x000D_
iii.	The 25 members will be provided with support to ensure that they are able to pursue stable livelihoods through their choices._x000D_
iv.	Post their successful transformation and integration into the mainstream, their stories and experiences will be shared with their community, to inspire other members to initiate transformations of their own, both with and without the support of our project. This will ensure project sustainability in a cyclically constructive process._x000D_
v.	The transgender community will be able to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty and exclusion and achieve mainstream status._x000D_
_x000D_
Detailed description of project structure and envisioned results:_x000D_
1.	Our first focus will be on the identification and selection of the first cohort of 25. A formal application structure will be constructed via which participants will be selected on the basis of their willingness to sustain their participation and who we feel will be genuinely benefitted from our programme design._x000D_
2.	The second process will involve conducting healing and self-empowerment workshops for 25 selected members of the transgender community. These workshops form a core part of PfP’s work and will be led by PfP facilitators experienced in conducting journeys for young people on the themes of gender, sexuality, and social inclusion. A typical workshop will consist of various 1-2 hour interactive sessions which enable reflection, learning and sharing on concepts linked to self, gender and leadership. Diverse and successfully validated tools such as verbal sharing, bonding activities, films, theatre, storytelling and writing will be used to create an intense space that initiates self-transformation and confidence building._x000D_
•	To enable the selected hijras to recover from the impact of gender based violence in their lives. Our goal is to create a sense of inner strength/confidence for them to shed existing inhibitions, acknowledge and begin the pursuit of their dreams, interact easily with society, and feel at ease in mainstream situations._x000D_
3.	Post the healing and strengthening process, we will begin a process of career counseling and guidance to help the participants identify the choice with which they wish to proceed with - between education, employment and entrepreneurship - based on their interests, aspirations and skills. This phase will be conducted by a skilled external professional selected by the project team._x000D_
•	Detailed preparation and planning for access to training, skills, finances and information will be undertaken. Sessions on soft skills training will be conducted. There will also be a scholarship amount of INR 5,000 earmarked for each participant which they will utilize for specific purposes, depending on their choice:_x000D_
-	For Education: determining and aiding in fulfillment of eligibility criteria, application for scholarships, preparation for entrance exams, support for admissions and other logistics as and when required;_x000D_
-	For Employment: identifying the relevant vocational skills, collaborating with training institutes to enroll participants in relevant courses, contacting and pulling on board gender inclusive employers;_x000D_
-	For Entrepreneurship: validation of business idea, proposal creation, planning, funding, accounting and entrepreneurship training._x000D_
_x000D_
On the basis of feedback collected through pre-project interviews regarding the aspirations, ambitions and preparedness of community members, the initial cohort division, project design and budget structure has been built on the expectation that 5 participants opt for education, 10 opt for employment and another 10 for entrepreneurship. _x000D_
_x000D_
4.	After the formal delineating, all the participants will be provided with mentors who will guide them in their chosen fields and help them manage the various personal and professional challenges that may arise._x000D_
5.	The concluding long-term process will involve the first cohort of participants being positioned as role models. Their stories and experiences will be taken back to the community to serve as sources of inspiration for other hijras. This will create a strong empowerment process via which the currently existing cycle of poverty and exclusion will be broken, encouraging more community members to pursue their dreams, and eventually widening and accelerating the mainstreaming process for all._x000D_
","By December 2016: A cohort of 25 Hijras will be empowered through our healing, guiding and training programme which will help them to identify the occupation stream of their choice and pursue the same in mainstream society. We expect 5 participants to pursue the education they wish to and gain admission to the appropriate institutions, 10 to undergo vocational training and be placed in stable jobs and 10 to open their own enterprises and run it sustainably.","The hijra population in India is estimated to be anywhere between 1.2 to 4 million. More than 70% of them live in rural areas. The level of literacy is very low in the community, just 46%, compared to 74% in the general population. Only 38% are employed. The community exists at the extreme margin of exclusion, having little access to socioeconomic spaces which will allow them to lead the life of a human being with dignity. 

They wish to be able to get educated, access mainstream jobs and establish secure and stable livelihoods. For them, economic transformation is an automatic guarantor of social elevation. Our project seeks to provide them with an avenue through which they are able to live lives as part of the mainstream. By gaining access to simple yet necessary opportunities such as education, employment and entrepreneurship, the community can gradually shift from the fringes of marginalization and begin to empower itself. 1O"

The $ 25,000 in funds would be used to establish a state-of-the-art resource center in one of the deprived communities in the southern part of Ghana called Madina. The resource center, which will be equipped with 30 desktop computers, a projector and   high speed internet access, will serve as the training center for the students._x000D_
The GTech club aims to educate, inspire, and equip young girls with the skills and resources to pursue opportunities in computing fields. These young ladies will learn how to code, develop websites, mobile apps, animations, games and more by the end of the project._x000D_
The volunteer teachers from the selected schools will be trained to take charge of the clubs in their various schools. Hence part of the funds will be used to design user guides to assist the teachers and the girls with the teaching and learning of the various models of the coding project, so that they may refer to them as a reference guide for training and practice outside the GTech project.  _x000D_
_x000D_
In addition to creating training and reference materials, the GTech project will use part of the funds to create awareness and interest among girls from the Madina community. In order to achieve this, the GTech project plans to print t-shirts for GTech participants, create and distribute brochures, and hold advocacy seminars in the community. The aim of these measures is to engage the community in the essence of the GTech project and integrate families and the community as liaisons in accomplishing this goal. By integrating these measures alongside existing awareness projects we hope to reach the majority of girls’ ages 9-14 living in Madina and hopefully inspire them to pursue an interest in technology and coding._x000D_
_x000D_
The GTech project also consists of other important nurturing activities. The girls participate in field trips to technology companies in order to give young girls exposure to careers in technology. We encourage them to envision their future as women working in IT and tech fields and provide opportunities for them to network with those in the field. We bring in guest speakers from the tech sector to talk about their careers and also do presentations on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topics to broaden their horizons in these topics in line with ICT. We will also organize Inter-school competitions for participating schools to enable us to assess the progress of the girls and their interest in what they are being taught. _x000D_
_x000D_
As part of coordinating affairs and organizing the project to achieve its objectives and success story, we will bring on board a good human resource team which will include volunteers, project coordinators, organizers etc. therefore part of the fund will be used to provide for them incentives, allowance and all the necessary motivation for a successful project. All the above mentioned activities will be funded using the $25,000._x000D_
","By December 2016, we aim to educate 530 girls in basic coding skills with our training project. In the process 26 teachers and 10 volunteers will be trained. 12 ICT clubs will be created in these selected schools. We expect that out of the number of girls we are going to train 150 of them will further their education in technology and take up careers in the technology fields. ","Around the world, women and girls still face overwhelming obstacles when it comes to accessing and shaping technologies. The digital gender divide is wide and getting wider. Worldwide, 200 million more men than women have access to the internet, and women are 21% less likely to own a mobile phone and while women make up about 40% of the total global workforce, they only comprise 25% of the tech industry. In today’s world, digital technology is central to political participation, information sharing, and economic development. Yet in spite of the increasing importance of technology, women and girls everywhere are missing, underrepresented, and dropping out from technology fields. As a result of this inequality, today’s world does not reflect the diversity of women’s experiences, imagination, or ingenuity.  Therefore, the GTech project is in to close the gender gap in the technology sector as well as to turn girls from technology consumers into technology producers.BO"

2015,254,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,,Empower and transform Women Processers into entrepreneurs in bangle making value chain in district Hyderabad,Fast Rural Development Program,Pakistan,Pakistan,0,,['Entrepreneurship & Business'],"Pakistan’s labor force is estimated to amount to 58 million in 2011 and its participation was stood at 33 percent, which is very low compared to 45 percent for other South Asia countries and over 50 percent for advanced economies, according to IMF report based on Pakistan Labor Force Survey. Sindh is the province of Pakistan which has two mega ports and its biggest cities like Karachi and Hyderabad are the industrialized cities where most of the women laborers are engaged in working in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods and cotton. Motor industries and the Bangle markets are the famous places where the informal bangle industry is flexing its muscles in this area. They usually placed in the factories at nominal wage rate which is like the pinch of salt for their unseen wounds of their basic rights. There is violation of their rights i.e. violation of right of social and personal security, wages below the minimum wage rate of Pakistan that is 8500 or 7500, unreported sexual violence, abuse and harassment, threats and lack of privacy and   job insecurity. They are usually worked in unsatisfactory working conditions and usually harassed by their male supervisors. This area of Hyderabad is responsible for a earning through its export quality goods and services which are prepared by these under privileged women and men. Due to poverty and inflation the number of home-based women workers is increasing. Through the ages women support their families by stitching and sewing .In present scenario, women are involved in other form of works like the carpet making and bangles. Their earning is so small that it would be hard to run a home by their own. The biggest impact of this situation is that women and men are in severe debts. They do not have a proper income which they could spend on their health. Instead of that, they are trapping in kidney problems and severe backache .If anybody in their home would be severely ill, they are not able to treat him or her in any hospital either government or private. Their children are out of school because their family earning is too small to run the house hold .This shows that our women laborers in bangles industry are in the social crisis which would be burst anytime. Lack of education and insufficient working condition is another side of the picture. The Bangles of Hyderabad are renowned in the world. The industry has semi formal and semi informal structures.  75% of the women labor force is attached with bangle industry in Hyderabad industry. This industry either opens in one room or in residential areas. Women are working on the gaseous stoves of methane under unsatisfactory conditions like dim light and absence of the fresh and cool air. This generates harmful effects on the lives of thousands of women and adolescent girls. _x000D_
They are usually sexually harassed by their male counterparts and they do not report the sexual abuse and sexual violence against them to anybody. These Bangle structure are also informal structure which is not properly registered with the government Labor department. Labor Unions regime has the turtle speed for the implementation of the labor policy 2010 which emphasize equal opportunity easy access to the working places, safety and security within the premises, denial of sexual harassment for the women and girls._x000D_
In Hyderabad,   Pakistan People’s Party, MQM and Pakistan Muslim League political parties looking very active talk different issues but still Women Labour Rights are still ignored in manifest toes of all political parties. The manifesto of the MQM 1998 shows that it is only talk about the male labourers and the child labour. The women laborer role and her active participation is not shown anywhere .The labour policy indicates only the benefits and the share of the laborers in the industrial units. The women are missing from over all policy._x000D_
The manifesto of PPP 1998 is looking over the whole scenario under the shade of the ILO convention and it talks about the basic human rights. But where is the women labor? The manifesto does not show any place for the women laborers. Its labor policy only takes into account the laborers as a whole without any gender sensitive labor policy. It is quite interesting to note that no any single manifesto contains any specific data of the women laborers and their issues and addressing of their problems._x000D_
Key focus is needed on two fronts: reforming statutory regulations that encourage job creation within the formal economy and creating programs that help informal workers adjust to labor market shocks and build future earnings potential. A lot of our skilled labor force today is being poached by foreign countries getting better wages, sometimes what they get here; slowly devour our labor force and leaving a big gap within the country, affecting internal productivity. This is obviously having a direct impact in our formal job market , as lot of people who are on contract tend to go for other jobs , where they are incentivized better or more efficiently leading us further away from the solution. We do believe in protecting jobs but the focus should be to protect workers._x000D_
In this context, FRDP requires that to implement the project for the women in bangle industry of Hyderabad so that their art and craft would be properly marketed and to link them with the proper businesses in order to provide them proper encouragement for the better earning of them.",300 women home based workers trained & they started their own business.,"1)	Women’s status within the household is improved.

The result focuses on linkages building of the women art and craft with the business market and thus improves their say at household level. FRDP has in the past sought to address the women access to business markets through empowering women economically. In the project period there is an increasing understanding that women access to the business markets is very much focusing with the inclusion of the establishment of the women entrepreneurship. 





2)	FRDP and local communities are actively engaging with stakeholders  



The project phase would highlight the need to ensure that networking and information sharing between the different actors engaged in economic uplift of women should be improved. Within this programme concerted efforts will be taken to ensure that the work in this project is linked to the work of other actors in the area.

We expect that this project will be the main solution to the challenges facing society in the light of the shortage of electricity in the rural economy, it will also be a solution in education, entrepreneurship, agriculture and corrupt environment in Tanzania","We hope that through this project, the community of Nzega will be enabled to get the electricity that helps in live them every day, young people will have had knowledge that helps earn enough and there entrepreneurship among communities living in rural areas, trade market increases, the society intends to issue water, milk , students in schools will have electricity and participate well in school and pass their studies.","Various challenges prevent rural people in Tanzania to access efficient sources of energy. Majority of people in the areas use Kerosene & firewood for lighting & cooking. Use of such sources of energy produces a gas that contributes to unwanted climate change & leads to emission of smoke which is said to cause cancer. Women & children are main victims of cancer caused by smoke. The current energy situation overburdens women & limits advancement in education & business.According to the Energy Policy 2003, only 1% of population in rural areas has access to electricity. The rest 98% use firewood which implies alarming rates of environmental destruction; For instance many rural people live below poverty line; facilities to access electricity and services are more expensive in rural that in urban because households are scattered. 

Yet, the challenges associated with the efforts to enable rural people to access efficient energy are manageable. The starting point is to inspire & equip young people from remote areas by encouragement them to continue into the field of making Solar, empower them to move forward in their lives, freedom to create, control their own futures & income.

2015,252,MN,Mongolia,MN,Mongolia,MN,Mongolia,MN,Mongolia,,one World One Line  ,'Mongolian National Federation of the Blind' MGO,Mongolia,Mongolia,0,,[''],"What we want to do with USD25.000 is give an IT education to25 young blind women and severe low vision which is not common in Mongolia and give them a computer with special software which they can use for their own education and the education of other women in their living area. In the Mongolian culture men are for centuries considered as superior to women and that they can accomplish anything they want and women have to worship their husband and follow his lead. Women are seen as weak and get therefore in general more education than men to enable them to take care of the family and provide income in case their husbands don’t. Blind and visual impaired women however do not get education because they are seen as of no value to this system, probably not getting married and not have the role other women play.There are however blind and partially sighted women who want to participate and have education to get a more independent life. There are very limited possibilities for education of blind women due to the common idea in society and among their family members that they don’t need education. For access to information and education they need access to the internet and learn skills to work with a computer, because other information is only available in the special school for blind children in Ulaanbaatar, vocational trainings and limited information the branch offices and the main office of Ulaanbaatar can provide in Braille or via talking books due to budget limitations. _x000D_
The Goal of the “One World One Line” project is providing IT training with JAWS Screen Reader and equipment to open up a way to education and a better life for the blind and severe low vision young women and girls. Computer training with screen reader JAWS {Job Access with Speech}proposed in this concept note is the core tool to maintain them to enjoy their right to education, information, employment opportunities and socialization. Screen reader and text-to-speech application are the accessible technology specially designed for the blind easing an approach to use technological progress. As a result blind young females will become able to turn their future and current life in a meaningful way._x000D_
We want to randomly select 10 visually impaired young women from 10 provinces which have a local information center and 20 visually impaired young women from the districts of Ulaanbaatar.  In Ulaanbaatar is an information center annex library for the blind.It is important that those women can use the information centers to study and pass their knowledge and skills to other blind young women in their environment._x000D_
We want to provide them with a laptop which they can carry out whenever and where ever they want to use it with specific software called JAWS; Job Accessibility with Speech. JAWS is developed by “Freedom Scientific” USA with English speech and the Mongolian speech was developed by the Mongolian National Federation of the Blind in cooperation with the IT Specialists of the University of Mongolia and University of Science and Technology under the auspice of the Princess of Thailand. Jaws enables blind and partially sighted people to use a computer same as persons without a vision impairment. The costs of the laptops with the special software will take about 6.000 USD under the condition that the best 10 students will be awarded with mobile computers._x000D_
This project or training is going to be conducted by the blind for the blind;so it is two-sides beneficial. MNFB has full potentiality to conduct the JAWS {Job Accessibility with Speech} computer training due to its human resource, technical and technological and location capacities._x000D_
The venue  the training will be held is the Rehabilitation and Training Center subsidiary to MNFB where the students from rural areas are enabled to live for the duration of the training and take their training in the classroom at the same location. The Traineris totally blind young men who has been working for the “Best FM 98.5” radio for last few years and is educated in Malaysia participating ICT Teruko Ikido Training. As the trainer is totally blind himself, he knows well enough how to train visually impaired as he learnt the methodology under the same conditions. He will be part of the implementation team._x000D_
_x000D_
However MNFB on one hand has accumulated some experience in conducting the same training several times,for instance, for its Board members and other members, mostly men, present proposal is distinguished as a lot of possibilities will be given to the blind and visually impaired young women and girls, who are sitting home not knowing what to do and how to spend thousands of days in front of them. Our project is more providing a chance for them to efficiently use the mobile computer for their livelihood improvement for the sake of being involved in talking computer training and to enable them to advocate possibilities to other blind women in their environment._x000D_
As you can see in the video, positive cases of young women who are being trained and have been trained already in one side. But in the other side, there is a representative of hundreds of females who are still in disadvantaged circumstance of geography, finance and disability._x000D_
MNFB is the only legal entity who has been thriving towards building both legal and physical environments to have the  persons with vision impairments enjoy their human rights. It organizes and conducts blindness skill trainings such as IT, mobility orientation, English language, massage course and Braille in the extent of the programs and projects supported by the donors. Also, MNFB is fighting against and cooperating with the government Agencies to build legal environment for all  108 000 persons with various types of disabilities in a way of drafting recommendations of the amendments to me added up into the currently applying national laws and legislations for the well beings of  disabled  community._x000D_
Things being so, existence of sole entity of the blind, headquartered in the capital city of Mongolia which is impossible to reach out many others residing in outskirts and rural areas. Therefore, we are this time taking an advantage of the chance provided by the Project Inspire to dedicated some force for those targets who are always out of our services because of lack of parental care, state provision of essential needs and demands, limited capacity of our organization and several types of disadvantages the target group is in._x000D_
The resource MNFB can guarantee is the venue with training room equipped and dormitory for students from the countryside and a well experienced trainer specialized in accessible technology for the blinds._x000D_
","As this computer training is integrated with accessible technology screen reader the target women and girls will learn to working on computer and their desire to benefit from accessible technology progress will be inspired. This training is more directed to give skills which the participants can directly use after the training. In this way, we are resolving fundamental issue which has become an obstacle to education, information, employment, socialization._x000D_

•	To be accepted by the society showing their  competency in reality _x000D_
•	To be desired  to do goodwill for her and oth","We want to make a statement against the general assumption in the Mongolian society that blind and severe visual impaired women don’t need education because they cannot contribute to society, by giving 25 blind and partially sighted young women IT training which enables them to get access to information and education and to inspire and help other blind women.About 80%of the blind people in Mongolia don’t have access to information. Mongolia is a large country with a low degree of infrastructure and besides the capital city of Ulaanbaatar only a few cities with over 20.000 people. The rest of the population lives in remote areas. Although the MNFB has branch offices in all 21 provinces of Mongolia it still has a lot of difficulties to reach out to them.

The committee will oversee all of the cooperatives operations to ensure that all decisions made are for the betterment of the cooperative, the women and the village._x000D_
80% of the funds (USD $20,000) will go towards providing loans for the women to start a farming based agriculture business. Loans of NPR 20,000 will be given to each woman to purchase materials and tools that are necessary for farming such as seeds, fencing and water pumps._x000D_
Each woman will then be advised on what crops to plant based on an analysis of what the market demands are as well as what expertise the woman has. This is to ensure that the women grow only crops that are in demand. The women will then be given the most technologically advanced seeds for their crops to ensure their harvest are of higher quality, quantity and more resistant to diseases._x000D_
A supply chain will be created and designed for each cooperative that will connect the cooperative to a market. The objective of the supply chain is to ensure that the women are able to reach out to a larger market that will ensure all their produce are sold and at a higher price compared to what they would have received if sold within their village._x000D_
After 1 month of receiving the loan, the women will start repaying the loan. The loan is repaid on a bi-weekly basis over an 18 month period at an interest rate of 15% per annum. The collection method is specifically designed so that each woman pays their collection to the group leader who in turns pays it to the cooperative’s treasurer. Whenever a transaction is made, both parties sign each other’s ‘Collection Log’ book. This removes the cost of hiring a collector whilst empowering the women by giving them the responsibility of ensuring collection of funds is done in a timely manner._x000D_

These women headed households now survive on what crops they grow on the piece of land they have and the livestock they keep. Most of these families are under the poverty line with a monthly household income of less than USD $100. The Hatpate Cooperative projects aims at empowering women headed households by providing them capital to start economic generating businesses that are agriculture based which will allow the women to increase their household income which in turn will result in the lives of everyone in the household such as children improving.

Forming a committee from the women empowers them with the control of how to expand their operation and how to better serve their community.

The project staff facilitate nutrition and health education through peer education among  women groups","In rural areas of India malnutrition is a serious nutritional problem resulting in different types of diseases, retarding growth, increases the risk and duration of illness, reduces work output and slows social and mental development and poor health.Malnutrition among women of reproductive age increases  risk of mortality during labor and delivery and puts their newborn children at risk of long-term deficiencies. Improving nutritional status, including micronutrient status, can lead to increased productivity, increased child survival and growth, and reduced maternal morbidity and mortality. 

For poor households, vegetables and fruits are the only source of micronutrients in the family diet. Homestead production of fruits and vegetables provides the poor people the direct access to important nutrients that may not be readily available or they cannot buy in market. Hence, kitchen gardening is an important strategy to improve household nutritional security and income generating activity

2015,246,PH,Philippines,PH,Philippines,PH,Philippines,PH,Philippines,,e2-BAE ASENSO (Empathetic and Empowered: Bridging Abacá Economic Advancement and Social Emotional Nature for Societal Opportunities)  ,"Move This World, Inc. ",Philippines,Philippines,0,,['Education'],"This project advocates to empower women and girls of the Higaonon tribe in the hinterlands of San Luis, Malitbog, Bukidnon, whose over 200 hundred hectares of ancestral land is planted with abacá (scientific name: Musa textilis). Unfortunately, their remote location and lack of training leaves them vulnerable to being taken advantage of by middlemen who buy the raw abacá fiber at very low and fluctuating prices. Currently the tribe’s vast abacá fiber production brings very little economic and socio-cultural opportunity to women, leaving them less productive and economically disempowered The Higaonon people are socially inclined, have a strong sense of community, and enjoy favourable conditions for growing abacá, making them well suited to take on the challenge of social enterprise.  _x000D_
It is in this context that a group of PeaceMovers of Move This World-Philippines proposes a year-long program that aims to provide economic and socio-cultural opportunity for Higaonon women and girls by using solar-powered equipment to process raw abacá fiber into Higaonon-inspired handicrafts. Believing that pairing Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) with design training and access to simple technology will awaken the inherent strengths of the Higaonon people in a sustainable way, the project will include two congruent phases.  The first phase is six months of empathy-based programming on resilience, team building, diversity appreciation, conflict resolution, and cultural preservation anchored in Move This World’s evidence-based curriculum. Given the context of ongoing interreligious conflict in Mindanao, developing empathy is particularly important for peace building in the region. Recent studies found that social integration is more important for well-being than income, and also decreases poverty (The Economist, 2015). _x000D_
_x000D_
Using SEL to empower individuals and promote healthy teamwork will lay a strong foundation for the second phase of the project: six months of training on how to process raw abacá fiber into handicrafts inspired by Higaonon designs (such as bags, caps, sandals, and wallets). In this way, women will be empowered with tangible skills to participate in the community’s industry of abacá processing while preserving and sharing their indigenous cultural heritage. In partnership with relevant government agencies, the second phase of training will include materials identification, solar-powered machinery use and maintenance, product creation and design principles, and entrepreneurship skills.   _x000D_
_x000D_
With global partners from the United States, Colombia, and Germany, Move This World will then connect Higaonon women and their products with the global market, ensuring all profits go directly to the community instead of middlemen. A small group of community members will receive specific technology training to manage an online sales platform.  Given the challenge of a remote location, the local government will help with transportation of goods. Community members will be equipped to take over leadership of the project and help train other communities for future project replication. It is hoped that this project’s unique focus on both social and economic resilience will empower women, encourage strong community teamwork, and create meaningful change for the Higaonon people.    ","By December 2016, we aim to directly empower 75 Higaonon women (both married and single ranging from 18-55 years old, with preference to widows and persons with disabilities) through our two-phase training program focused on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and Higaonon-inspired handicrafts made from abacá fiber. It is expected that all families of these direct beneficiaries will experience a 25% income increase within the year and 40% sustainable increases in each subsequent year.  It is also anticipated that 25 of these women trained will become Program Trainers who will help Move This World in program replication after three years of project implementation.  _x000D_
Other goals evaluated include 50% increased communication and collaboration skills, self and social awareness, and emotional identification and management skills; greater number of women in community leadership positions; and reduced number of conflicts requiring mediation and community-level crime and violence.","This project addresses gender inequality as manifested in the Higaonon women’s economic and social disempowerment. Women are currently not involved in abacá fiber production, leaving them with little to do all day and no financial self-sufficiency. The continuing clash between the government and Muslim secessionist groups in Mindanao makes females even more vulnerable; due to fear many girls dropout of school and mothers cannot look for income outside the tribal vicinity. Women are also concerned about the prevalence of girls’ early marriage and pregnancy due to lack of opportunities to participate in the community. 

The Higaonons rely on the income generated from abacá fiber production but their lack of training and remote location leaves them no choice but to sell the fiber to middlemen who control the price and get a higher profit than the Higaonons themselves.  Having no access to equipment, they are manually processing the fiber, limiting the amount of fiber they can sell. WM"

Currently built on the Mxit platform, we want to develop the app to reach more users. We want to translate content into regionally appropriate languages in addition to promoting the app in schools in order to provide girls with an interactive health curriculum. _x000D_
Through implementation of mGirls, girls not directly participating in Girls & Football SA workshops due to limited resources, still have access to important health information. _x000D_

Although a growing portion of the world is using smartphones, the majority of communication via mobile phones in Africa happens with simple models. These simple models are affordable for the youth in Africa, and are thus widely utilized. As data in Africa can be very expensive (users pay per use of gigabytes), Girls & Football SA maximize cost efficient mobile phone usage to ensure more girls have access to the information they need, and that a conversation surrounding girls’ health needs takes place. For many of the female youth in Africa, it is impossible to download data heavy content, which in turn limits their access to health information. By providing them with accessible, accurate and appealing content, more health information reaches its target audience. _x000D_
_x000D_
Although various institutions within Africa are campaigning towards decreasing the number of youth affected by HIV/Aids, unfortunately basic health information is lacking. Although youth may know that they should not get HIV/Aids, they are not fully aware of how to contract this virus and other communicable diseases, in addition to the fact that they are not aware of the other changes their body might be going through. If a girl does not have a healthy relationship with her body, she will not be able to exercise her assertiveness to its full potential. Girls may not fully understand which avenues of help they have a right to. Thus, part of the value of a mobile health campaign lies in starting an honest conversation early on, when girls are at a stage in their life where they can ask questions and make smart and healthy choices based on accurate information at hand. _x000D_
","We aim to develop across the continent and integrate with the Department of Basic Education in South Africa to ensure each girl in Africa has access to accurate health information. _x000D_

","We are providing girls in Africa with accurate health information they need. The Girls & Football SA educational and interactive mobile health campaign in Africa is an initiative geared towards girls aged 10 – 19, one of the continent’s most vulnerable demographics . Research shows these girls do not have access to the health information they need , nor do they have access to the same communication channels as many youth their age do. Making accurate information available is crucial. By opting in to receive weekly health facts, girls not directly involved in Girls & Football SA workshops gain access to important health information they need. By encouraging dialogue and communication between girls in this demographic, Girls & Football SA and strategic partners are able to generate information and identify areas in girls’ development in dire need of improvement. Through interactive quizzes and games, girls are encouraged to participate in a health dialogue.SW"

2015,243,AU,Australia,SB,Solomon Islands,AU,Australia,AU,Australia,,Solomon Islands Cervical Cancer Screening Program,Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation,Australia,Australia,0,,['Health'],"ACCF intends to use the funding from Project Inspire to develop and implement a cervical screening and treatment program that will be delivered to 2000 women in 2 districts in Solomon Islands in a 12 month period. The screening program will be delivered to remote areas and communities within these districts, by using innovative mobile technology. The Mobile Colposcope, from Mobile ODT, is a device which uses a mobile phone to visually inspect the cervix and uploads the results of the screening to a cloud-based database. This alleviates issues surrounding access to health services for women due to immobile, traditional screening equipment and long delays on test results in developing countries. The mobile colposcope is extremely portable which means it can be easily transported to remote areas, compared to traditional screening technology which can only be utilised at a fixed location. The device is robust, connecting to a simple mobile phone network, such as that available in the Solomon Islands.  The relatively simple application software allows this device to capture images on the phone and upload them to a cloud-based patient database for more accurate record keeping. The money awarded from this grant would specifically contribute to the purchase of 2 mobile colposcopes as well as cover the costs of having a specialist doctor at on-site screening clinics for patient consultation, facilitating training workshops for nurses and midwives in the use of the mobile colposcope and screening practices, the printing of training handbooks, and the cost of evaluating and reporting on the screening program.","The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates 35 women die each year from cervical cancer in SI, although discussions with the national cancer registry indicate these statistics are from the NRH, and are not inclusive of data from provincial hospitals. With funding, we can commence a screening and treatment program by August 2016 that will screen 2000 women in the Isabel Province and Honiara City Provinces with the final mobile screening clinic to be delivered in December 2016. The benefits to these communities include:• Reduce cervical cancer deaths by 40% by ensuring that each eligible woman has access to at least 1 cervical screening and enabling treatment of any identified precancerous lesions._x000D_
• Increase access to cervical screening and treatment services amongst eligible women by providing screening in less remote areas using visual inspection and mobile colposcopes in remote health facilities._x000D_
• Increase Pap test coverage by training midwives, doctors and nurses.","Official statistics rank cervical cancer as the second most frequent cancer in the Solomon Islands (SI). This represents only 20% of the estimated cases with most women living in remote areas, having no access to services. Reports from the National Referral Hospital (NRH) show that the number of women presenting with cervical cancer is increasing over time and they are presenting with late stage disease making treatment largely unsuccessful. This aligns with WHO projections that cervical cancer will double within 20 years in SI.  SI does not have an organised screening program and pap tests are only available from the NRH, a clinic in Honiara and 2 provincial hospitals.  Pap coverage is estimated to be between 1-2% of the eligible population each year compared with the 60% considered normal in Australia or the US.

Students then have an opportunity to tweek projects to make them more effective and test them again and a winning team is announced. Students are also trained to be good mentees and are paired with mentors who are trained to assist our students to transition from high school. Our final component is partners from engineering industry send engineers as role models and offer scholarships to our GirlEngers. Our program is going to use the prize to amplify our reach and programs for girls in Africa to educate, inspire and mentor them to become future engineers.","Our target is by June 2016, we would have had 3000 girls in South Africa and Kenya on the GirlEng Information sessions. We will work with a shortlist of 200 in deep impact workshops and expect 80% to apply to engineering and in 5 years graduate as engineers.","GirlEng was developed to create greater awareness around engineering and engineering related careers and  increase the application rate for girls to pursue studies in engineering. Currently, in Africa, girls have limited access to career opportunities, due to a number of socio-cultural barriers and incorrect perceptions around engineering. In some countries the number of women within the sector is as low as 3%. GirlEng creates greater awareness, and links maths and science education to engineering. It showcases engineering in a fun and practical light, and is targeted at girls at high school between the 9th – 12th Grades. The program has already run for 5 years in South Africa, and had our first cohort of GirlEngers graduate from engineering degrees. The program is a proactive bottom up approach to address educational and skills challenges and is will be scaled to Kenya in 2015.TM"

Yet, the rate of female labor participation is a low 6.95% of the whole population. Being such a high proportion of the population and providing such a low contribution to the economy is detrimental to the growth of Pakistan. Another challenge the country faces is the scaling energy crisis peaking at 7000MW this year with 57% Pakistan living in darkness. Buksh Foundation has created the “Lighting a Million Lives” (LAML) project that tackles these challenges in win-win stakeholder model._x000D_
The project was launched in January 2013, sparking women economic empowerment and enabling access to clean energy in off-grid rural areas with a community based enterprise to thousands of poor households burning kerosene fumes. Each village 50 households (300 individuals) equipped with a centralized solar charging station with 50 IFC certified solar lanterns, 1 trained woman entrepreneur (The Light Lady), and 1 technical agent trained to gain technical capacity building for the village. Certified by the UN Foundation, International Finance Corporation, World Energy Council, and Forbes Magazine, LaML has proven to be a successful model of change in Pakistan having electrified 150+ villages with a total impact on 45,000 lives, especially women and girls. _x000D_
_x000D_
Generating funds has been the toughest challenge- using creative means to catalyze investments from a diverse donor base including corporate sector, development institutions, politicians and philanthropists we have been able to reach 150 villages till date. In order to scale to our target of a 1 million lives (out of which 50% is women) and reach to 4000 villages we seek the support of technological innovations. We aim to set up an online crowd funding portal, based on the KIVA International model, to diversify and multiply our sources of funding and reach a larger audience. The crowd funding portal will provide pictures and profiles representing the challenges each potential Light Lady and 300 villagers undergo because of darkness. Each $5,500 raised through this portal will allow 300 individuals to get access to light while 1 woman will gain economic independence. _x000D_
_x000D_
Secondly, the Foundation has found it challenging to import the solar charging stations in Pakistan at a high cost. These solar products could easily be assembled locally, making them more affordable and repairable, and ensuring sustainable energy for all. To achieve this, we need to carry out research and development on how to manufacture the stations in Pakistan. This is our vision to create bottom-of-the-pyramid assembly lines and green jobs amongst the rural communities. Accordingly, we will train the trained 150 female entrepreneurs and create a network of solar micro-entrepreneurs. The 150 women will be trained on the local assembly of the solar charging station and lanterns. Once trained, they will replace our current field employees’ role to train new female entrepreneurs in the next villages that will be electrified. _x000D_
_x000D_
With the $25,000 Prize money, we seek to build our capacity to reach 4,000 villages and impact 1 million lives. _x000D_
","By 2020, we aim to create 4000 female energy entrepreneurs in 4000 rural villages of Pakistan impacting 1 Million lives with multiple social economic and environmental benefits. ","Buksh Foundation has a persistent mission of stabilizing communities and in order to fulfill this, women empowerment is essential as they form 50% of the society. Our organization is promoting gender equality in rather conservative areas and reducing cultural biases through LaML. The project specifically targets young girls (youth), disabled women, mid wives, single mothers and extreme poverty ridden women. Through LAML provision of light is directed towards increasing female security and protection against theft, rape and other social crimes. We select and train women in business and entrepreneur skills to run the solar charging stations, and earn a permanent source of income. As women are accepted as breadwinner in the communities, girls also have a 30% increased opportunity to attend schools and be recognized as a potential economic agent of the society. In addition to this, many other challenges are tackled by the project including, health and stabiliization of communities. WC"

Research has shown that bringing together children with and without disabilities have positive implications for both groups, such as improvement of social discourse and communication._x000D_
In Uganda arises now a window-of-opportunity for since the government recently more gave attention to children with mental or physical disabilities. For example, voted in 2006, The Persons with Disability Act and the government ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008. These instruments promote access, equity and quality of education for children with disabilities. Moreover, the Ministry of Education and Sports has created a department that focuses on Special Needs and Inclusive Education._x000D_
Angel's Center responds to this new policy and wants to expand its activities to pilot project around inclusive education.

Scope: As part of the new government, Angel's Center for Children with Special Needs wants to carry out a pilot project on inclusive education. The project will be implemented in three primary schools in Wakiso district because the Angel's Center for Children with Special Needs is in this district and has already built up a large network in 2015. The project will contribute to phase out children from the Angel's Center and will ensure that their needs and rights are respected within mainstream education. In the first year would be 10 children with disabilities enrolled distributed to three primary schools in Wakiso.  Angel's Center will work closely with the National Union of Disabled Persons of Uganda, which will also contribute to raising awareness about the project as well as the drafting of a curriculum. In addition, Angel's Center will collaborate with the Wakiso district as well as the administration of the school to ensure that all the necessary infrastructural adjustments to the school environment have been achieved. The teachers of mainstream schools will be trained in teaching children with disabilities. Because bringing together children with and without disabilities do not necessarily lead to inclusive education will be invested a lot of time in counseling and sensitize the students, teachers and school staff framing. _x000D_

Với mục đích nhằm nâng cáo tiếng nói, vai trò người phụ nữ trong gia đình và cộng đồng thông qua các hoạt động giúp họ tăng năng lực và độc lập làm kinh tế. Dự án hy vọng mang lại lợi ích cho 880 phụ nữ (bao gồm 120 chị được hỗ trợ vốn vay, 750 chị tham gia các lớp tập huấn và 10 chị trong nhóm tạo việc làm) và gia đình các chị trong đó 85 % là trẻ em. Với số kinh phí từ nhà tài trợ, dự án sẽ tiến hành các hoạt động sau:1.	Tập huấn tăng năng lực cho phụ nữ nghèo các xã Tân Thành, Tân Thuận và Thuận Quý. _x000D_
 	* 120 phụ nữ nghèo của các xã sẽ được nâng cao kỹ thuật trồng trọt/ chăn nuôi nhằm đa dạng hóa sinh kế (thông qua 10 lớp tập huấn kỹ thuật nông nghiệp), chăm sóc sức khỏe cho gia đình (10 lớp tập huấn sức khỏe cộng đồng). Các lớp này do các chuyên viên của Dự án đứng tập huấn. _x000D_
 	* Bên cạnh đó họ còn đứng ra thực hiện các lớp tập huấn chi tiêu tiết kiệm trong gia đình sẽ giúp phụ nữ cách quản lý chi tiêu phù hợp hơn. Để tiến hành lớp tập huấn này thì chuyên viên của Dự án cần được đào tạo chuyên sâu, nên đã mời 1 chuyên gia ngân hàng về đào tạo trong 1 ngày. Sau đó, 10 lớp tập huấn về cách quản lý chi tiêu sẽ được tổ chức trong cộng đồng 3 xã này với thời gian 1 buổi/ ngày._x000D_
 	* 10 phụ nữ có tay nghề được đào tạo chuyên môn hàng quý 3 tháng nhằm nâng cao kỹ thuật làm hàng ráp mãnh (mền bông, áo gối,…) có khả năng đáp ứng nhu cầu đặt hàng của các cửa hàng trong nước.  Đây là nhóm các chị do hội phụ nữ huyện/ xã đề cử thành lập, đa phần các chị biết kỹ thuật may vá cơ bản và đang thất nghiệp, hoặc gia đình có hoàn cảnh đặc biệt khó khăn. Các chị sẽ tự bình chọn người trưởng nhóm và tận dụng nhà nhóm trưởng là nơi làm việc cho các chị, cửa hàng sẽ chi trả 1 phần tiền thuê nhà và điện nước hàng tháng. Thường một buổi tập huấn sẽ được tổ chức tại nhà trưởng nhóm và diễn ra trong 2 ngày, chuyên viên thiết kế/ kỹ thuật từ cửa hàng Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh (TPHCM) chịu trách nhiệm đứng tập huấn mẫu mã và kỹ thuật thiết kế hàng quilt mới, các chị cùng tham gia đóng góp ý kiến cho mẫu mới cũng như thảo luận về các phương pháp nhằm đơn  giản hóa các kỹ thuật phức tạp từ nhóm thiết kế đưa xuống.  Trong một số trường hợp, các chị có thể đề xuất trực tiếp hoặc gián tiếp lên cửa hàng các mẫu sản phẩm theo ý tưởng của mình. _x000D_
2.	Giúp phụ nữ nghèo có khả năng độc lập về tài chính. _x000D_
 * 	Ưu tiên 120 phụ nữ đặc biệt khó khăn tại 3 xã này sẽ tham gia chương trình vay vốn tín dụng nhằm đa dạng hóa sinh kế. Đây là những hộ thuộc danh sách  hộ nghèo hoặc cận nghèo do chính quyền địa phương đề cử hỗ trợ. Bên cạnh đó, chúng tôi còn có 1 đội ngũ mạng lưới cộng tác viên – là những người địa phương, cán bộ hội phụ nữ xã – sẽ giúp dự án đi sâu sát hơn, tìm hiểu hoàn cảnh gia đình của từng chị và lựa chọn các chị phù hợp nhất với các tiêu chí của chương trình (ví dụ như: gia đình các chị có ý chí làm ăn vươn lên thoát nghèo, có nhiều con đang đi học, có khả năng thực hiện các mô hình đa dạng hóa sinh kế: trồng thanh long, chăn nuôi heo, gà, vịt…). Sau khi cộng tác viên đề cử danh sách các hộ, nhân viên địa bàn của Thiện Chí sẽ kết hợp với họ thăm nhà và khảo sát chọn hộ lại một lần nữa trước khi người quản lý chương trình phê duyệt.  Các khoản vay nhỏ được cấp trong khoảng thời gian năm tháng và số tiền từ 2.5 triệu – 5 triệu đồng. Sau khi khoản vay được hoàn trả, gia đình có thể chuẩn bị sẵn sàng cho khoản vay thứ hai nhằm đầu tư và đa dạng hóa doanh thu của nó. Để đảm bảo phụ nữ phát triển an toàn cả về đời sống sức khỏe, vật chất và tinh thần, dự án còn giúp hỗ trợ tiền khám chữa bệnh cho khoảng 40 trường hợp phụ nữ mắc bệnh hoặc phải cấp cứu khẩn cấp với điều kiện có sự tham gia đóng góp của cộng đồng nơi họ sinh sống. Một số phụ nữ có con còn đang tuổi đến trường thì sẽ được hỗ trợ học bổng trị giá 500,000 đồng/ suất (100 suất), phần nào hỗ trợ các chi phí sách vở, dụng cụ học tập, hoặc đồng phục mới cho trẻ đến trường._x000D_
 	* Hàng tháng 10 phụ nữ trong nhóm tạo việc làm  sẽ nhận các đơn đặt hàng từ các cửa hàng đối tác – là doanh nghiệp xã hội Mekong Quilts (www.mekong-quilts.org hoặc http://mekong-plus.com ). Dự án sẽ hỗ trợ họ chi phí vận chuyển sản phẩm hàng ráp mãnh đi đến các cửa hàng hàng tháng. Đây là công việc mang lại thu nhập ổn định. Mỗi 3 tháng, trưởng nhóm hoặc người phụ trách chính trong nhóm sẽ có 1 tuần trực tại công ty tại TP HCM để tiếp tục được học hỏi các kỹ thuật về thiết kế mới cũng như hỗ trợ điều chỉnh những sản phẩm lỗi và sau đó về truyền đạt lại cho các chị khác trong nhóm._x000D_
3.	Dự án còn sử dụng khoảng 11% tổng kinh phí xin được để chi trả cho các chi phí quản lý dự án. _x000D_
Dự án tập trung nhiều vào tính sáng tạo và bền vững của chương trình như sau:_x000D_
Tính sáng tạo: _x000D_
Chúng tôi luôn khuyến khích tính sáng tạo thông qua các buổi tập huấn kỹ thuật tạo việc làm để tăng tính sở hữu sản phẩm cho các chị, vì đó là sản phẩm do các chị trực tiếp đóng góp sáng kiến  tạo ra. Các chị được phép tham gia ý kiến vào mẫu thiết kế mới, cũng như góp ý những phương pháp kỹ thuật đơn giản, phù hợp hơn. Bên cạnh đó, các chị luôn được khuyến khích tìm kiếm đề xuất những mẫu thiết kế mới cho cửa hàng. Một phần thưởng từ công ty Mekong Quilts nhằm khích lệ tinh thần vào mỗi dịp cuối năm dành cho những chị có tinh thần đóng góp sáng kiến và hoàn thành xuất sắc các sản phẩm/ đơn hàng được giao. _x000D_
Tính bền vững:_x000D_
 	* Thiện Chí có 1 một đội ngũ nhân viên gây quỹ - họ sẽ chịu trách nhiệm tiếp tục tìm kiếm những nguồn tài trợ khác cho các giai đoạn sau khi dự án kết thúc. Bên cạnh đó chúng tôi hướng đến những sự kiện gây quỹ bền vững như tổ chức sự kiện chạy xe đạp gây quỹ từ huyện này sang huyện khác hoặc từ Việt Nam sang Campuchia, mỗi người tham gia sẽ đóng góp một khoản tiền nhất định để chi phí cho  chuyến đi cũng như tài trợ cho các chương trình của dự án. Toàn bộ số tiền thu được sẽ hỗ trợ các chương trình hoạt động._x000D_
 * 	Mối liên kết khắng khít giữa doanh nghiệp xã hội và nhóm tạo việc làm tạo ra tính bền vững cho chương trình. Thiện Chí chỉ là trung tâm trung gian hỗ trợ các chị thực hiện giao dịch, nhận đơn đặt hàng, mẫu thiết kế từ cửa hàng gửi đến nhóm tạo việc làm, cũng như truyền đạt lại cho công ty những ý kiến, đề xuất từ các chị. Công ty là đơn vị trực tiếp order và gửi trả tiền lương làm đơn hàng cho nhóm. Vì vậy, để tiếp tục duy trì sự ổn định cho nhóm tại địa phương, ban lãnh đạo công ty cũng rất tích cực tìm kiếm nhiều chiến lược thu hút khách hàng, nâng cao doanh thu để phát triển công ty, trong đó tập trung cải tiến nhiều mẫu mã thiết kế mới phù hợp với thị hiếu khách hàng._x000D_
 	* Hơn 80% nhân viên Thiện Chí là người địa phương, họ nắm vững hầu hết các quy trình chuyên môn kỹ thuật cũng như liên hệ với các cửa hàng tại TPHCM. Điều đó có nghĩa là chúng tôi có 1 nguồn lực nhân sự địa phương ổn định cùng với chính quyền địa phương tiếp tục vận hành các chương trình sau khi dư án kết thúc._x000D_
 	* Sau khi dự án kết thúc, Thiện Chí dần chuyển giao chương trình cho các đối tác địa phương có trách nhiệm duy trì nhân rộng đào tạo các đối tượng phụ nữ khác._x000D_

•	Sau 1 năm tham gia chương trình, các chị trong dự án duy trì các công việc làm hàng thủ công, hoặc/ và các việc nhằm đa dạng hóa sinh kế.","Các xã Tân Thành, Tân Thuận, và Thuận Qúy huyện Hàm Thuận Nam nằm trong danh sách những xã có số lượng người nghèo nhiều nhất trên toàn huyện, phụ nữ trong các gia đình khó khăn luôn là nạn nhân của các vụ bạo hành, đổ vỡ hạnh phúc. Đơn giản là vì họ chỉ ở nhà nội trợ, còn đàn ông mới có thể tham gia làm việc, đem tiền về nuôi gia đình. Vì thế, mọi việc trên dưới trong nhà đều do người đàn ông quyết định, phụ nữ chỉ nghe và làm theo, họ không có bất kỳ vị trí hoặc vai trò gì trong cộng đồng, thậm chí tại gia đình. Bởi không làm ra tiền nên họ không có tiếng nói trong gia đình.Phần lớn phụ nữ ở đây không có việc làm bởi vì ngành nghề chính của vùng là nghề biển, chỉ dành cho người đàn ông sức dài vai rộng, hoặc làm việc trong ngành dịch vụ - du lịch (resort, khách sạn,…) nhưng với họ lại bị hạn chế nhiều kỹ năng cần thiết.

Vấn đề được chỉ ra là phải nâng cao vai trò người phụ nữ trong gia đình và cộng đồng thông qua các hoạt động giúp họ tăng năng lực và độc lập làm kinh tế. SC"

India is headed towards a digital revolution, this intervention builds on this concept and shall stress on use of mobile and internet not just for communication but for the overall empowerment of women. RLEK will capacitate women belonging to traditional forest dwelling communities, Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes, minorities through capacity building initiatives in the arena of digital literacy.  It would train women to use mobile technology to protect and promote their rights and entitlements. This would involve trainings on e-governance (submission of forms online, printing requisite information etc.), e-banking, e-reservations, e-retail and shopping etc. Trainings will also be imparted to women Self-Help Group members to further entrepreneurship development as they will be facilitated to use digital tools to establish market linkages, promote sales of their products etc. The project will be befitting model which uses Information and communication technology to help the most marginalized groups to take up entrepreneurship development and business literacy. “It is/will be a journey from Jungle Age to Digital Age”. This whole process will enable a bottom up approach to the overall development of marginalised women who lack access to basic rights such as health, education, decision making.  _x000D_
The traditional forest dwelling women community i.e. the Van Gujjar women live deep in the forests, away from human habitations and are normally cut off from any roads or telecommunication facilities. They face a vicious cycle of lack of - infrastructure, development and policy implementation. The ‘digital divide’ is worst for them as they are poor, have low levels of literacy and live in remote forest areas. ICT is a tool for communication and interaction for some but for the Van Gujjars, it has been used as a weapon to bring social change and a revolution in their lives. The ‘digital divide’ negates economic and social opportunity for them. The process of equipping the Van Gujjars with wireless handsets was witnessed at the time when the communication revolution had not unfolded and the digital age had not set in. With no landlines, mobiles or any other connectivity means as these communities live deep in the forests these wireless handsets opened a range of opportunities for them. The use of information technology by these communities not just served as a means to communicate but also helped them in maintaining the ecology, addressing health emergencies, gender inclusion and providing the communities a voice in the system which was earlier absent. It has also helped the community in asserting their rights over the forest and empowering them in the real sense. Their familiarity with the use of wireless technology has made it easy for them to easily adapt to the use of mobile phones. It is from this stage that the present project will be taken up thereby digitally empowering these groups to further their rights and entitlements through the use of communication technology._x000D_
","By December 2016 – 3000 women will be capacitated to use communication technology to further their rights and entitlements and 1000 of these young women will provide handholding to other rural women to use ICT for entrepreneurship development and business literacy. Further, RLEK will be making these young women legally literate and digitally confidence and thus minimizing the women trafficking problem in the hills.  ","Women face gender disparity, problem is even grimmer with women from Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe, traditional forest dwelling communities, embroiled in the vicious circle of poverty, illiteracy, lack of decision making etc. When it comes to digital literacy this disparity is even starker. Women from these communities have to cope with rugged topography making access difficult. Women Self-Help Groups involved in income generation activities are not digitally empowered.     

This is seen as a tool to provide gender inclusion and equity. Using Information and Communication technology will instill self-confidence in women, mobilize them on public issues and make them active partakers in the process of decision making. The otherwise ignored women issues such as health, sanitation, education of the girl child will be taken up. It will provide them the skills to sell their produce and establish linkages for entrepreneurship development & business literacy.  AD"

Women lag men in many areas of financial planning, and yet women bear significance responsibility in family’s subsistence.

These women living in slum areas find it hard to educate their children as a result most children may drop out of school or join school late. However, education and financial empowerment is the key to eradicate poverty in a community.



The solutions provided by this venture have been lacking in the communities we work in. It introduces a method in which the poor are able to access solar lighting products through micro-loan that would not be possible for the residence to access given their low income.

As other countries of central Africa, Rwanda constitutes of different communities with different cultures and different living conditions. A community of indigenous people currently known as historically marginalized people (HMP) is the one and the most disadvantaged group with a lot of marginalization, stigmatization and violations committed on them. They were living in the tropical forests and in some volcanoes and hills (Rwanda). Since the years of 1977 up to 1995 they were evicted from the forests in order to establish national parks. But unfortunately the integration policy of the government was not successful and failed because indigenous people of Rwanda known as Batwa (ethnic name) or historically marginalized people continued to face a lot of marginalization and violations from their neighbors other communities for example; children in schools, women in villages, men in public works, this affected them to feel inferior and no confident in the whole life. The women from the community of historically marginalized people are the most victims of violations and marginalization. Rwanda has promoted gender equality and empowered a woman in every aspect of lives but unfortunately HMP/Batwa women are still facing many violations of their rights including domestic violations. In enabling this idea/project, we have initiated to train HMP women in different corners of the country. The training is on gender basic violence, woman violence in general, human rights especially women rights and self advocacy. After a 6 days session of training, the trainees will go to train their fellow’s women and their partners’ men. Gender basic violence is a serious issue in sub-Sahara African countries including Rwanda but most particularly in the communities of indigenous people of Rwanda currently known as historically marginalized people, so women trainees are to go to train other women not only in HMPs families but also in other communities in order to increase their confidence too!. This is where the title of the project “HMP WOMAN GENDER AMBASSADOR” came from. Project activities _x000D_
Activity 1: Field descent: Selection of 50 women (girls) trained trainers. This activity will last one (1) month._x000D_
Activity 2:Training:  50 women (girls) trained trainers are to be collected at the same place (hotel) for a 6 days training session. Main training concepts are gender issues among family members, trust between man and woman, role of woman (historically marginalized woman) in community development and country in whole, human rights especially indigenous rights. Other discursive concepts are relationship between HMP and other communities, malnutrition issues (how to prepare a complete meal) and so on…. This activity mixed with a mid-reporting will last 1 month. _x000D_
Activity 3: community based training: 50 women trained are to go in different corners of the country in their communities and neighbors to disseminate what they have acquired from the training. In Rwanda there is the so called in Kinyarwanda “AKAGOROBA K’ABABYEYI” means “PARENTS’ EVENING” where only parents in every village take 2 to 3 hours discussing many issues for resolutions and advice each other and this is a very Rwandan traditional culture. So the trained trainers’ women will be profiting this parents’ evening to train and disseminate the message in different villages.   This activity will last 2 months. _x000D_
Activity 4: Monitoring and evaluation: The project is about to be put at the end, so we have to evaluate and monitor all project progress to see if we are successful or not. It will be taking 1 month to evaluate and monitor the activities._x000D_
Activity 5: Final reporting: Final report of all activities is to be made after monitoring and evaluation. The report well be sent to the institutions partnered in implementation process including the funding organization and others if are there. This activity is to be done in 1 month. The project according to this implementation plan is about six (6) months to be completed. _x000D_
","50 women are to be trained in one six days session in a hotel. The training concepts as stated in the first paragraphs are gender issues, human rights and self advocacy. As sub concepts; on gender issues (main discursive concept of the project) we will have a look on: 1. what the role of HMW (historically marginalized woman) in gender equality monitoring, 2. How a HMW can be a big part in family development including family planning, 3. What a HMW can contribute in the development of the country in whole. In human rights especially indigenous rights and self advocacy we will try to see if it is possible to restore the pride of HMP in general most particularly for women because if you develop a woman you develop the whole family. After training, trained women who are expected to be 50 women are to be sent in different corners of the country to train and educate their fellow men and women on what they learned. Is expected that each trainee woman will cover 20 families; this means that f","As stated above, gender issues continued to be a serious problem in Rwanda. If we have a look in one part of the country which constitutes a group of people marginalized through history or historically marginalized people mostly known as Batwa where they don’t participate and benefit from a lot of public policies including the policy of fighting against gender based violence because they are considered as ignored people. Is still there gender based violence in rural and remote areas including HMPs villages where gender equality is being misunderstood! This leads to a continuous discrimination of women in those areas and sometimes death occurred through violence done domestically in some families. A woman is the most victim of gender based violence, according to the statistics made 85% GBV (gender based violence) committed are against women and others committed are against men and children. So the problem to be solved is the very huge domestic violence most particularly in HMP families.AE"

This project aims at helping rural women to acquire an economic knowledge which enables them to make money, in one hand. In the other hand, the project is planning to reinforce women’s ability in playing a role of health protection in their family to reduce health expenses and the wastes of time related to patients’ treatment. A theoretical and practical training will include four fundamental rubrics:•      A training on apiculture through which the work of apiculture ( which consist in mastering the lifestyle of bees and their roles, knowing what is produced by bees and its use, knowing how to build beehives and to put them in adequate environment, knowing the techniques to capture bees, mastering the accompaniment of beehives and bees, knowing the techniques of honey harvesting) together with the valorization of derived products from the beehives and the commercialization of those products will be taught to rural women/girls; _x000D_

•       A training  on nutrition and health which consist in teaching women/girls, nutrition habits to have a good health, teaching the essential hygiene rules and also teaching them the notions of family planning to control and space births; and finally_x000D_
 •        An accompaniment of the activities of the future entrepreneurs during which the practice of the received training will carry out by the installation of 2 beehives on the sites of each concerned trainee. Moreover, the honey producers who will want extend their capacity of production, an accompaniment will be carried out with microfinance structures to have access to necessary loans. A co-operative of apiarists will be created for the coordinate commercialization of honey and the derived products from the beehive in order to facilitate the access to the market. _x000D_
These modules are complementary. Two modules aim at the financial empowerment of women (apiculture and the accompaniment of women). The functional literacy and the training on women’s nutrition and health aim at reinforcing self-confidence, decision making at both individual and familial level, social position and human rights._x000D_
That training will last one year knowing two days of training per week. It will be done on a site located in the community of Savè in the village of Ouoghi where there exists a familial apiarist farm of team leader gathering 50 beehives. The quality assurance of the training on apiculture will be carried out by the solitary apiarist enterprise « The Beehive of the Hills » situated about 50 km from the village of Ouoghi. The training will be done in the local language and given to 30 women and girls aged between 18 and 50 of the region of Savè (with a view to reduce the expenses related to the trainees’ lodging). The same step will be followed later to extend the training to the candidates from other regions in Benin. _x000D_

2015,222,AU,Australia,KH,Cambodia,AU,Australia,AU,Australia,,Free to Shine: Girls Human Rights & Leadership Program,Free to Shine,Australia,Australia,0,,['Education'],"The Cambodian government signed the Human Rights declaration in 1947, yet the majority of Cambodians still live without their basic human rights. Free to Shine will implement a program that enables at-risk Cambodian girls to become strong, independent leaders in their community. This will be done by educating and facilitating them to provide human rights first-hand to families in their community. Starting with 18 girls, who we already know are passionate and interested, the Education Outreach Officers (EOOs) from our Siem Reap office, will train and support them through each stage of this program. The goal by the end of the grant period is to have 54 empowered girls who have provided clean drinking water to 300 families, adequate housing to 36 families, vegetable gardens to 60 families, and education on human rights to many more. _x000D_
Our program will be based on the principles of the Barefoot College program; to train girls to not only be leaders but also facilitate them to learn their rights, question social oppression and do something hands on about community issues they recognise. The program will be outlined by our team but designed and implemented by the girls themselves with guidance from the EOOs. This is an example of how the program could run;_x000D_
_x000D_
The first 18 girls placed on our program will be taught their human rights in depth by the EOOs. Together they will brainstorm how to bring these rights to their community. The girls will be split into three groups of six with one EOO mentor per group. The focus will be on three main areas; health and sanitation by providing access to clean water, adequate shelter by repairing and building homes, and enough food by providing vegetable gardens and training. Each of these three areas will also involve the right to education as the human rights will be explained to those recieving them. Together with the EOOs, the girls will select the families who are in most need and most deserving, then rejoin the others, explain what they have found and work out how to structure the implementation. _x000D_
_x000D_
The program will run once a month on a Saturday and start with stage 1 - implementation and education, stage 2 - expansion - where the girls continue implementation but on a larger scale maybe through community meetings or group lessons and stage 3 - maintenance and sustainability - this involves the girls going back to the original families to ensure everything is running properly, answer any questions or help with any repairs/issues. This first group of 18 will then go to another community and train the next group of 18 girls to implement the same program in their village, eventually resulting in three communities and 54 girls. _x000D_
_x000D_
This program is about creating a better Cambodia through providing people with the human rights they are entitled to, without relying on the government’s help. The communities we work in are in rural Cambodia, these rural areas tend to receive the least aid simply due to the difficulty of reaching them. This is why we believe that this grassroots effort to provide aid from within the communities will be far more efficient and effective than waiting for the government to reach these areas with external aid._x000D_
","By December 31st 2017 we will have trained 54 girls (aged 12-18) to be community leaders, they will have provided human rights to 100 families in each of the three communities they are from. _x000D_
List of goals:_x000D_
1. Train 54 girls to understand what Human Rights are and how to implement them (proven by a quiz following the classes)_x000D_
2. Provide 6 families in need with their right to adequate  shelter by building them a house_x000D_
3. Provide 36 families with their right to adequate shelter by repairing unliveable homes_x000D_
4. Provide 300 families with their right to clean water and good health by giving them water filters_x000D_
5. Provide 60 families with their right to be healthy with veggie gardens and the ability to grow their own food_x000D_
","Despite the Cambodian government signing the declaration of Human Right 67 years ago, a high proportion of people in Cambodia still live without them. During our Human rights classes, the girls became passionate to fix this problem, with the government not doing anything they thought “why can’t we do it ourselves?”. Bringing safe drinking water, adequate shelter, education and more to the people of their comunities instilled a sense of pride, achievement and leadership that has changed and motivated our girls. “Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.” - Ghandi6P"

Fish stocks and fishing communities are facing unprecedented challenges to their sustainability and existence.

We will create a Committee of Creditors that will be managed by activists hired by the project over a certain period of time, will make a follow-up to the group of beneficiaries savings  and revolving credit in Maxaquene , neighborhood of Maputo. At the end of a monitoring cycle, it is expected that the groups reach the maturity and do not depend on the systematic monitoring of a promoter / organizer paid by the operator (Committee of Creditors). Where, after the end of the cycle the groups still require monitoring, KULIMA will make appropriate follow-up on the indicators obtained during the period of project activities. In general, despite the fact that there are operators and private lenders or even individual, the number of group members, will define the frequency of meetings and lower and upper limits of the savings value in relation to the available budget for creditors. But in general, the financial activity of this group consists to mobilize savings of its members, creating a sustainable business based on this savings, extend credit on which minimum interest rates will be charged, thereby generating income to be redistributed by the members of new group at the end of a given cycle cover and allowing more girls.The payment has to be necessarily monetary. The funds circulating among its members and its collection and distribution work generally on trust and empathy at the same time requiring each member to make savings of a predetermined amount and within the previously defined frequency for payment of its share with 3% interest. The distribution of savings among the group members is done periodically and alternately. We will work more with girls who dropped out of their schools divided to early pregnancies and that this time embraced the small business to survive in order to give more input in their small businesses. We will start with each with a 100Euros of credit where to reach 150 girls in the district. We will add this credit activity, the activities related to HIV / AIDS as cross-cutting issue as the prevalence in Maputo will increasingly growing and the victims always are these unprotected girls._x000D_

","Taking into account the socio-economic characteristics of the neighborhood, the track record in terms of the poverty level and the particular interests that may be linked to the nature of the program, the community leaders and members indicate the need for a two ways to solve some problems in theses communities (savings and access to financing), others in only one direction (or access to credit). These communities are nearly the town and do not have places to make agriculture to sustain their families.During the implementation of the project, the information will be guided by the Committee of Creditors created by KULIMA, the group of activist to work with the beneficiaries will be monitored regularly to insure the success of the business._x000D_
On the other hand, the reasons behind the emergence, operation and role of the Creditors Committee regarding the lives of the members may make the effectiveness of different connection options with KULIMA and the sustainability of the girls business ","In Maxaquene neighborhood, many young girls in adolescence phase (12 – 18 years) are forced to leave school due to the lack of financial conditions. Some of these girls had no opportunity to go to school and support themselves and their families; they prostitute themselves at risk of unwanted pregnancies and HIV transmission. In fact in the community of Maxaquene neighborhood, many girls become sexually active at the age 12 years being vulnerable to infection of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV and AIDS.Those girls have different obstacles to school access, related to the domestic workload that play, early marriages and their role as caregivers, especially in a context of vulnerability.

Many of them have become heads of their families very early due to the death of their parents even to their divorce where everyone go to start the family in others provinces.

These girls, who would not have otherwise had the opportunity to get a job, are equipped with necessary skills and an opportunity to actually begin a career that may end in the pursuit of their entrepreneurial dreams or positions in the companies where they intern. _x000D_

Paradigm Initiative Nigeria conducted baseline studies in Ajegunle, the most popular and most populous slum in Lagos Nigeria in order to determine the access that young people had to web-enabled technologies. 46.5% of the respondents were girls between the ages of 14 and 26 years. While some of the male respondents were artisans, most of the 113 female respondents said that they were at one level of schooling or other. Further data collected from those who applied to PIN’s initial trainings however revealed that there were no real plans for further education for most of the young people. With large family sizes and parents earning meager incomes if any, many of them could not afford to pay for the university entrance examination, much less pay their way through school. Again, while up to 48.7% of female respondents had encountered a computer mostly in a common learning room at school, only 7.9% of the girls had learnt any useful or productive skills and only 8% of them owned or had unrestricted access to a PC. When asked why, answers range from lack of money (to purchase PCs or other web-enabled devices or pay for training) to no time or lack of parental consent. However, there was 94% acknowledgement of ICT application importance and 87% with high expectations for ICT/Entrepreneurship training opportunities among the young people. _x000D_
_x000D_
Qualitative data gathered in a focus group discussion more recently revealed that women and girls especially face even deeper barriers than their male counterparts in accessing and using the technology.  High costs, socio-cultural biases (such as women’s role in family life or male dominance and supremacy), and access to education and knowledge seem to be the underlying critical factors. In one of our focus group discussions also conducted in Ajegunle community of Lagos Nigeria, February 2015 involving 23 women between the ages of 30 and 50, only 3 of the women use the internet to one degree or other - and only one of them uses it regularly for social interaction and for staying informed. The other 2 of the 3 who use the web go after it only when they need information. Four of the women own smartphones and only one of them owns a desktop computer. Over half of the group struggled to comprehend the meaning of such words as 'the internet,' 'the web' or 'browsing.' This would seem very strange because Lagos is the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, with a teeming population estimated at about 12 million. Yet, in one of the most popular and most populous slums in Nigeria, majority of the women go about their struggle for survival, completely cut off technology and the web._x000D_
These trends were amplified while analyzing data from another focus group discussion involving much younger women; ages 18 to 30. The girls were drawn from various underserved communities in Lagos, Nigeria. While some of them already use the technology to one degree or other, they identified cost of access (to devices and the web) as the main constraint to access and use of web-enabled technologies. Fewer still understood the benefits of web-enabled ICTs, and even less had the skills required to access, integrate, evaluate, or create online information. Worse still, 8 of 15 girls had experienced harassment and bullying online, but none of the victims had either reported this to anyone or confronted the perpetrator(s). When asked the reason for this ‘silence,’ silence filled the room. In many African cultures, girls are raised to be subservient and accepting. They are not expected to ‘raise’ their voice or be heard. This ‘culture of silence’ by itself is responsible for the perpetuation of many forms of discrimination against and abuse of women and girls._x000D_
_x000D_
Under-served communities, such as Ajegunle, account for majority of unemployed, derelict and abused women and girls; many of them who are involved in precarious lifestyles involving vulnerable sexual relations, substance abuse, prostitution, teenage and unwanted pregnancy, and other vices whose negative impact on the society are high. Focusing on combating poverty and unemployment, with attention on girls in underserved areas is very deliberate. Empowerment for women and girls is a pressing need. Sixty percent of the 100 million school age children in the developing world are girls who grow up without access to basic education.1 Globally, women’s chances to benefit from the advantages of the information society are one third less than men’s.1 According to Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI)’s Affordability Report 2014, '…while Internet penetration rates have increased dramatically in recent years, the pace of change seems to be slowing.'2 The report particularly identified that women belong with certain groups that are far less likely to be able to connect to the Internet affordably. There is research evidence to suggest that there are greater possibilities for women’s socio-economic empowerment through web-enabled ICTs. The aim of the project will be to use ICTs and other relevant skills training as an enabler for empowerment. _x000D_
_x000D_
Access to technology and training is a basic requirement for girls’ participation in the global information economy. GET ‘A’ L.I.F.E project aims to address the barriers young women especially face by providing digital literacy and digital rights literacy training for girls. The program will cover such topics courses as Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentation Programs & Databases, Design Tools,  Internet & World Wide Web (Introducing them to safety and security on the web), social media tools, securing online work, Business Planning, Enterprise Management, Leadership, Communication, Time Management, Team Work, Social Responsibility and financial literacy among others. A careful selection process will ensure that the training admits only those who need such intervention the most, have a high level of interest in learning and who would be available for training throughout the duration of the project. All training will be delivered by qualified instructors and/or professionals. The trainees will be provided with continued post-program mentorship and support for a period of six months after graduation. _x000D_
_x000D_
The training will take place in a conducive training facility complete with audio-visual training aid over a period of seven weeks. There would be four sessions (of seven weeks training) in the year 2016; each session admitting a minimum of 25 girls in order make a total of 100 girls trained after the four sessions. Training will be delivered through seminars, workshops, team building activities, group discussions & work, presentations, and other creative means aimed at making learning as creative and as fun as possible for the girls. Industry experts would be hired to deliver this training to the girls and they will learn for 4-5 hours each day. They will have access to computers and the internet throughout the duration of their training. Partnership will be sought with digital aid and internet service providers for the purpose of keeping the girls connected after their training. The training will be provided at no cost to selected girls between the ages of 15 and 28, drawn from under-served communities._x000D_

The girls would also be trained on how to bid for and complete online work, so that they do not have to wait in line for white-collar jobs. Our organization will facilitate internship placements for graduates of the training and provide them with continued post-program mentorship and support up to six months after completion of training. Each girl will be required to train 5 other girls upon completion of the training.","1.	Economic dependency and low self-esteem by giving the girls demand-driven and essential digital skills, and connecting them to jobs.  2.	High cost of access to training and digital technologies especially affecting the bottom of the pyramid by providing access to training and digital technologies for girls written off as poor and unable to afford life-changing programs.

3.	Revolutionizing traditional approaches to women’s empowerment & rights issues in Nigeria. For instance, access to social media training and tools is a particularly effective way for the girls to reach out and mobilize on a grassroots level in campaigns such as campaigns against gender-based violence, organizing public actions and reaching out across borders to mobilize support.

Foundation",Iran,Indonesia,0,,"['Education', 'Environment & Sustainability', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","The Bali Women of Indonesia Skills Education (WISE) programme works exclusively with women. Extensive studies from across the world show that empowering and training women creates far-reaching benefits:• The entire local community prospers_x000D_
• Living standards improve_x000D_
• Infant mortality falls_x000D_
• Use of family planning options improves_x000D_

• Children of skilled women are more likely to be educated_x000D_
By skilling-up women, families will be educated and whole communities empowered. R.O.L.E. Foundation believes that better educational opportunities for women will contribute to women’s empowerment and help them break out of the poverty cycle. Equipped with essential knowledge and skills for the workforce, 90% of R.O.L.E.’s students obtain full-time employment within three months of graduation._x000D_
The suggested project will directly benefit 25 women from disadvantaged, low-income and at-risk families from all over Bali and Indonesia, by providing them with free skills education for their personal benefit and to prepare them for the world of work. The courses, units and curriculum contents are tailor-made to respond to the needs of the labor market in Bali, principally focusing on the hospitality sector. _x000D_
Furthermore, the project will not only capacitate the beneficiary at-risk women from impoverished areas of Bali and neighboring islands. It will also provide experience and exposure to the Education Programme management team, made up of 4 Indonesian women. They will in charge of 1) Management, 2) Enrolment, 3) Administration and 4) Teaching for the Bali WISE programme, respectively. It is a key component of the curriculum planning exercise to ensure a programme delivery that is responsive to the current economic and societal needs._x000D_
The proposed project will contribute to ensure the smooth implementation of the Bali WISE programme in 2016. The scope of the Bali WISE programme in 2016 will be nation-wide scope targeting disadvantaged women from Bali and other islands of greater Indonesia. _x000D_
Students pertaining to the 2016 intake will be paid a monthly expense allowance so as to allow them to stop, underpaid and unskilled jobs with no future. Partnerships with hotels and companies in Bali will provide internships and work experience for the students. There is high demand for the Bali WISE graduates, with more than 90% finding full time employment within 3 months._x000D_
Training will be accomplished through contracting qualified, experienced trainers in enrolment, basic skills and hospitality.  The enrolment specialist will be contracted for a period of 6 months, and training specialists will be contracted for a period of 12 months. To assure that the project meets both the needs of the trainees and of potential employers, evaluation and feedback will be collected from each of these stakeholder groups.  Results will be incorporated into future training activities, thereby ensuring the project’s sustainability and on-going adaptation to the societal and economic needs of Bali._x000D_
25 students will benefit from the 6-month full Bali WISE Skills Education Programme. R.O.L.E. Foundation is, through this proposal, humbly requesting assistance from Project Inspire to sponsor the cost for the education of the 25 students for its first 2016 intake._x000D_
","Lack of education and vocational training are barriers to sustainable livelihoods and employment for women from poor communities in Bali and in Indonesia. R.O.L.E. Foundation aims to address this gap by providing basic education and vocational training through its Bali WISE component and to facilitate access and provide linkages to employers for Bali WISE graduates. The tourism sector has been selected for the vocational training component due to the importance of the industry in Bali. Tourism, however, is the world’s most competitive industry, and the less educated are not viable candidates for employment. Through training, Bali WISE offers poor and marginalized women a better possibility for entry and employment in this sector.Through its various components, the Bali WISE programme promotes a comprehensive approach to sustainable development for all on Bali, contributing to a liveable environment, an equitable society and a viable economic development for Bali._x000D_
","The explosion of tourism in Bali since the 1990’s has generated great economic growth. However, despite the high levels of regional and international investment in Bali’s tourism sector, many of its residents are not beneficiaries of this rapid development. As employment related immigration into Bali has increased, so has competition in the skilled employment market, leaving few work opportunities for the illiterate and unskilled.Lack of education and vocational training are barriers to sustainable livelihoods and employment for women from poor communities in Bali and in Indonesia. 1O"

The  Association for Social Solidarity and Empowerment Training Trust (ASSET)–  is a Non-Governmental Organization registered under Indian Trust Act of 1981 in 2011. Addressing Poverty reduction strategies with niche on environmental and ecological perspectives is the core mission of the Organization –  ASSET thus fosters grassroots level actions in pursuance of contributing to tackling issues related to the semi-arid agriculture, livelihoods of the rural   poor,   Climate   Change   and   networking   in   consultation   with   the   community   based organizations and the civil society institutions. The Organization  currently undertakes sustainable agricultural promotion  by creating  enabling environment amongst the resource poor farmers, both men and women farmers, through the range of  small  scale  interventions,  in  addition  to  work  for  Disability  Welfare,     Micro  Credit,  SHG Formation, Vocational Training and Networking._x000D_
_x000D_
Project Description: Name, Targeted Population_x000D_
_x000D_
‘Livelihood Enhancement through Micro Economy Support’ – LEMES – is the name we have given to our Project as its title, which will directly benefit 50 women from the ‘SHG’ promoted by the Association for Social Solidarity and Empowerment Training Trust. The women are from the Socially Excluded section in Tamil Nadu called ‘Scheduled Caste’, who were formerly the Untouchables in Indian social hierarchy. The intended population covers 15 families of the Landless agricultural labor category, with 75 heads of persons, including men and women, aged, physically challenged and children. The ultimate LEMES intervention and initiative is to learn from the best practices as how best micro economy support could  bring  positive  changes  in  the  lifestyles  and  contemporary  survival  and  poverty  issues pertinent to these selected 50 families._x000D_
_x000D_
Need Analysis: Needs, Process of Determination_x000D_
_x000D_
Needs:_x000D_
Women in Thiruparankundram Block, from Madurai District, Tamil Nadu, India, if we look at issues laterally, require many rights to exercise within the contexts of family as an individual unit and the society as a whole. Sadly, women lack importantly the bargaining power and decision-making, whether it be in reproductive health, family income and access to resources. In male-chauvinistic socio-cultural setting, systems and customs at different levels  impose restrictions  on  many women  by sidelining  them from mainstream development. Women basically require her rights to work, earn and generate income which is often the way she is forced by circumstances to struggle._x000D_
_x000D_
On another perspective, women lack access to quick sources of loans or credit facilities from established financial institutions such as the Banks for meeting their livelihood requirements. Micro economy  is  the  simple  and  quick  source  of  resource  on  which  women  can  build  trust  and collectively access this resource for gaining economic benefits or returns. In institutionalizing process, women form into small farmers’ circles as this process gradually unfolds space and scope for them to operate and decide functions independently. Women as Collective, they are the key determinants whose aspirations are taken into account when they conduct meetings and share concerns and issues collectively. This ranges from tracking economic resources to the level where gaining capacities and finally owning the end results thus there is an assurance that the whole processes enable women to improve the quality in livelihoods._x000D_
 In addition, other significantly relevant needs at the grassroots levels are [a] lack of capacity of local institutions of women  to effectively identify and respond to community needs or take advantage of opportunities offered, [b] shortcomings in social service delivery by local authorities,  [c] the lack of linkages  between  grassroots civil society organizations  and  authorities, which has  often  led  to policies with inappropriate strategies or limited absorption of good practices by communities, [d] the low level of grassroots participation in local development planning and decision-making, [e] market failures like information asymmetries and the lack of access to financial services,   and [f] low level of inclusion of women and disadvantaged and excluded groups in local development decision making, planning and implementation processes._x000D_
_x000D_
The Association for Social Solidarity and Empowerment Training Trust (ASSET)has in the past been familiar with community-driven consultations, appraisals, assessments and program planning in order to bring ownership on issues that they confront and how strategic directions might help them overcome.   The Project Team Leader, K. Amirthalingam, has been well trained by the Development Management experts._x000D_
_x000D_
ASSET had started discovering a modified and locally adopted logical framework analysis [LFA] – Object Oriented Program – Planning System [OOPS] methodology in order to evolve a planning process with the communities. The LFA-OOPS methods enabled ASSET to identify core problems [CP].   The purpose of the exercise was explained to the women members of the Small Farmers’ Circle. Hence, this process of identification of the needs and constraints represented the grassroots level concerns. Every actor sat down at various levels and contributed to this plan._x000D_
_x000D_
The participatory nature of the process ensured democratic decision making and also that everyone own the plan, be proud of creating it as well as be responsible for it. Key findings, amongst other social issues, generated from such a planning appraisal exercise have been broken down as follows:_x000D_
_x000D_
•Government-driven  concepts  of  ‘introduced’  and  ‘ready-to-take-away’  kind  of  Self  Help Group  formation  resulted  in  the deviation  of the social action  concepts  of many NGOs resulted in massive growth of SHGs and in many cases, owing to statutory privileges such as quick external Bank credit linkages, affluent sections of women benefited largely. There were widespread duplication of memberships and over-lapping enrollments from the women in ‘Above Poverty Line’ sidelining many rural women belonging to ‘Below Poverty Line’ indicator._x000D_
•It has been found largely at the grassroots level that those loans or credit facilities intended for  the  rural  women  incurred  more  on  meeting  ‘consumption  needs’  rather  than  the ‘livelihood needs’. It has been generally observed that the existing MC operations cross beyond 70% in fulfilling the consumption needs of the rural and urban poor – debt redemption, cultural and festivity related expenses, food and education and meeting health_x000D_
needs. This is not a sustainable solution for poverty elimination, as this doesn’t have the ability to show directions for the rural poor in overcoming hardships through self-reliant economic productivity._x000D_
•Smaller groups of poor women operating their Circles within the close proximity of their remote habitation do not have any access to external micro economy support, and ‘subsidy’ syndrome influence many poor women  and  men  that  the ‘loans’ they secure might  be waived off as ‘free hand-out’._x000D_
 _x000D_
•Loans and credit facilities availed from the local Money sharks and unscrupulous elements often bring the rural poor on the verge of vulnerability and bankruptcy. Interest rates are currently more than 36% to 60% per annum – which is an exorbitant amount of burden on the fate of the rural poor._x000D_
•Collective  acceptance  to  prioritize  the  economic  needs  of  the  intended  poor  women towards  availing micro economy at competitive rate of 18% of annual interest_x000D_
•Self and neighborhood monitoring on functions such as the Group as collateral, and built-in motivational factor amongst all intended women for prompt repayment of micro economy_x000D_
_x000D_
Expected Outcome: Goals, Measurable Objectives._x000D_
The  LEMES  [Micro  Economy  Demonstration  Program]  addresses  the  main  goal  of  poverty reduction in the context of sustainable development by supporting actions that seek to enhance the livelihoods of vulnerable rural populations and increase the efficiency of social service delivery among marginalized populations. The approach developed herewith fosters an inclusive rights- based and actor-oriented framework that empowers grassroots organizations. By building the capacity of local institutions and participants under the LEMES,   ASSET initiative will certainly support an inclusive and participatory society, while developing the basis for a more equitable society. LEMES actors [beneficiaries] will be provided with, and their access to critically needed resources [micro economy] will be facilitated on the basis of community driven initiatives and outlined priorities, thus meeting the aim of the program to ensure support to ‘own initiatives’. Precisely, the following framework will be beneficial to understand:_x000D_

2015,208,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,,PLAN B (Prepared Leaders Are Never Bothered),WE CAN,Nigeria,Nigeria,0,,"['Education', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Plan B reality showIt’s going to be a reality / mentorship training and real-time practicals programme, where we would bring young girls together to learn basic entrepreneurship skills, from photography, to music production, to IT, to make up artistry, tailoring, shoe making, hair dressing, event management, Graphic design, baking, printing, DJ, Interior decoration, catering, social media management and modelling. a broad variety of small scale businesses._x000D_
This project plan B is an unconventional approach towards the empowerment of young girls in entrepreneurship and business literacy. The project seeks to address three major bullet points._x000D_
_x000D_
1.	An alternative to a corporate career_x000D_
Because people believe success is all about going to school, reading a lucrative course, graduating and getting a good job, we are not saying don’t go to school, we are not saying don’t come out top of your class, all we are trying to do is save you from what psychologists would call future shock, all we are saying is things may work out but what if things don’t work out, what if.. And believe me here in the third world, the latter is most likely to occur. Hence we believe its better you have an alternative skill to depend on, a Plan B, just in case things don’t work out_x000D_
_x000D_
2.	Real time Field experience_x000D_
Plan B is acronyms for prepared leaders are never bothered… we have realized that most empowerment programmes only train participants and probably engage them in controlled practicals... But research has revealed that these same people are likely to get frustrated and consequently less likely to continue when they are eventually faced with real life experiences and most pressures that come with entrepreneurship, these pressures cannot be taught in any entrepreneurship class, or controlled practicals, they can only be experienced firsthand and on field._x000D_
Hence we hope to simulate a real time field experience, to give participants an idea of how it would be in real life, the interesting thing is that only we the organizers would be aware that it’s a simulation exercise, as the participant would be led to believe that they are engaged in a real life field experience, we would mount as much pressure as possible on the participant so much that when they survive that experience they are more likely to survive similar ones they may encounter after the project. After each real time field experience the participants would be debriefed and given extra tips for challenges they encountered and highlight the mistakes they made and how to subsequently avoid them. _x000D_
_x000D_

 The project is going to be an educative training programme in form of a highly entertaining reality TV show, which would only start airing after we have trained as many girls as possible, we would create a production on the participants we have trained that covers every step of the way on the various career training, so that by viewing the production alone other girls can share in the training and field experiences of the real participants hence creating a broader reach and impact in terms of entrepreneurship and business literacy.","We hope to have graduated our first set of trainees by the end of February 2016 from the Plan B camp, Being a TV reality show, we would only train 20 girls at a time to enable us fully showcase each girls strength and challenges and knowing that we also have secondary participants following the tutorial sessions via the TV show; we hope to also enable the TV audience properly monitor the progress of the programme and the girls development and even be able to compare results while they participate in the practicals in their respective homes (or wherever they are viewing from)_x000D_
We would also empower the graduants with relevant start up tools and provide them with mentorship through the setup of their business till they are properly grounded, then for the TV reality show, we hope to start airing it from June 2016 on a TV channel that shows on both local and digital platforms, i.e  African Independent Television, in order to enable those without satellite dish also participate._x000D_

To build sustainability, we must build a sustainable financing system, service system, quality control, and prepare resources. The hardest challenge we face is the community participation because this micro insurance system needs a lot of members to maintain it. Advocating to the leader in the community and commuity organization approach, which is a strengthin both cultural and structural schemes, is the solution for this problem.Our team focuses on the stage of development in GCI into massive duplication and takes a scientific approach for this new garbage insurance schemeby creating new programs in other regions (initiation), ensuring the power of sustainability (stabilization), and society independencing (independence). In developing this product, we have applied scientific aspects and conducted research in order to make the referral program a role model or a reliable innovative micro-insurance. _x000D_

Recent estimates indicate that about 18 percent of its population continues to live below US$ 1 a day, and about half lives below US$ 2 a day. Households spend about 2.1 percent of their total consumption on health, ranging from about 1.6 percent for the poorest decile and 3.5 percent for the richest, which is relatively low compared to other countries with similar income levels.This is exacerbatedby low management system of municipal soild waste, which has been linked to premature deaths, serious illness, and diminished quality of life.

We work with the same girls each year for five years and provide progressively more advanced instruction to them. The project will address the imbalance within STEM disciplines where girls and women are more likely to be users rather than inventors by encouraging them to build, design and invent solutions to real-world problems. Technovation for Girls will consists of a 13-week program in which secondary school aged girls will learn to create mobile phone apps using App Inventor, a beginner, blocks-based programming language and create a business plan. App Inventor was created at MIT as a way to hook non-programmers into computer science because it has a “low walls, high ceiling” design.The girls will work in teams and will be paired with female mentors from the high-tech community, giving the girls strong female role models while also educating and enriching the mentors’ lives. The girls will also be taken on field trips to high-tech companies, to give them first-hand knowledge of what a career in computer science is like._x000D_
Also, through online curriculum, girls will learn to think like entrepreneurs, generate innovative ideas, do market research, learn about the engineering process, write business models, and validate their ideas. At the end of the program, the teams will create videos of their pitches will be judged by a panel of tech and business experts. Regional winners compete in a high-visibility national pitch night which will challenge the girls by asking them to communicate their ideas, process, and final product to an audience and panel of experts (just like in the real world). The winning ideas will be incubated and giving seed grants to a lunch their ideas within the communities._x000D_
","By August 2016, we aim to educate 1500 girls through the Technovation for Girls program focusing on 30 public girls’ secondary schools from the six regions across Nigeria including Ogun, Oyo, Lagos, Kaduna, Rivers, Kogi, Osun states respectively. The launch will herald 1500 students to the T4Girls network, with 50 students from each school and the formation of the Techie Girls Club across the schools helping girls to learn real-world computer science and entrepreneurship.when you educate a girl in the developing world, on average, five people get educated because she will educate at least four other people through the course of her life. ","The Nigerian Science Foundation estimates about 4% of the workforce works directly in STEM and is responsible for much economic innovation and productivity. In the coming years many STEM occupations are estimated to grow faster than the average of all occupations, and some of the greatest growth will be in computer-related fields where women are underrepresented and hold a quarter or fewer positions. We need to attract more women in STEM, and in computer science specifically, so that they have an opportunity to contribute to and influence a growing field. By diversifying the workforce we will be able to utilize the scientific and technological talents and experiences of women, potentially increasing our abilities to solve some of the most difficult problems of our time. By educating girls, Technovation for Girls transforms the culture of computer science and business to one of cooperation and equal opportunity.

The district has also seen one of the country’s highest illiteracy rates of 59% for women and 51% for men. Women are engulfed in absolute poverty and are grossly marginalized by their husbands on grounds that they are unable to own property and cannot take financial decisions in their respective households. In this community women are the main source of household labor but they are not allowed to take financial decisions even on the produce, their participation ends at opening up gardens, growing crops and harvesting. After harvesting the responsibility of selling the harvests is taken by their husbands. VAD will intervene to address this problem through the following ways; _x000D_
	 Organize them in women groups where each member pays membership as commitment fee of approximately one thousand Uganda shillings (UGX 1000shs)_x000D_
	Training them in business setup and management skills_x000D_

	Women equally want their capacities built in advocacy and lobbying; women claimed that they are currently voiceless, even when they learn of availability of women support projects at the district, they currently do not know what to do to lobby for such support / funds._x000D_
	Support by training these women on how to manage their own identified income generated projects._x000D_
Women, youth and children have suffered from a number of waterborne diseases in addition to walking long distances looking for water. The distance between a water source and a household on average is 3.5 kilometers which consumes a lot of time and also expose them to defilement.

The project seeks to prevent and provide awareness on the dangers of Child marriages, early pregnancies, domestic violences, HIV/AIDS, child and maternal mortality, and children’s rights to the girls themselves, teachers, parents and the community at large. Through the project, those who were impregnated and have delivered will be encouraged to get back to school. The project is a national project but will first support 5000 girls from 3 districts namely; Chikwawa, Karonga, Mchinji. It is needless to say that if girls stay longer in school, they improve their economic potential, and are statically far less likely to marry young. Additionally, through workshops teachers will also be enlightened on how they can address denial and discrimination against girls at school, by enforcing gender appropriate policies and practices in the schools. the project will also enlighten traditional leaders and all the opinion leaders to eradicate the harmful cultural practices which disadvantage girls in the communities. The project will also provide school basic necessities such as exercise books, pens and uniforms to the most disadvantaged girls and those affected by the January 2015 floods so as to avoid poverty related school drop outs. We will also set up hotline and girl parallegal network committee in their communities where they can report any forms of abuses they encounter. Basically, families who cannot afford sending all their children to school often prioritize investing in the education of their sons over that of their daughters. On another note, poverty increases girls’ susceptibility to contracting HIV through several channels such as sexual exploitation, limited access to health care, nutrition, education and information and other basic services. Poverty also has the tendency of pressuring girls to engage in transactional sex in order to ensure daily survival. All these practices threaten girls’ safety and dignity and as a result they drop out of school.",By 2016 we aim to increase school girls' enrollment by 95% and reduce girls' school dropout to 2% in the selected districts. It is expected that those girls will go on up to secondary school and University levels,"In Malawi, girls are at disadvantage not just at home but also in the entire society, in which their education and economic alternatives are extremely limited. Often married to older men, in exchange of a sum of money, Malawian girls are evidently very vulnerable to domestic violence. According to the International Centre for Research on Women (2013), about 50% of young girls in Malawi are married before the age of 18years, some as early as 12 years old. Child marriage violates a number of rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC, 1989). As a result, most of these girls become victims of sexual abuse, sex trafficking and traditional practices such as ‘fisi’, a type of formalized rape. Additionally, poverty which is widely spread in Malawi impacts girls differently from boys. According to UNICEF, 61.1% of the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 per day. As shown by the World Bank, only 5% of girls complete their secondary education. TT"

","Though with variations, analysis of information from all regions reveals that the role of tourism in empowering women cannot be underestimated. Although economic empowerment has always been stressed, we posit that tourism provides all forms of empowerment albeit in more subtle ways. Through training and capacity building to enable several women run the tourism enterprises, psychological and physical empowerment is reached. Engaging in tourism enterprises not only breaks the social bubble that has always kept the woman in doors, but also raises her self esteem whilst providing an opportunity for the entire society to acknowledge what woman can accomplish outside the traditional home tendering. By this, woman attains social empowerment which further provides her with ladders to political empowerment.","While sustainable tourism development strongly emphasizes environmental issues, it seems that socio cultural issues have been overshadowed. Gender considerations need to be included in a critical analysis of the socio cultural impacts of these emerging forms of tourism.This project seeks to determine how a community-based tourism project promotes the empowerment of women. Empowerment is operationalized as a multidimensional process with political, psychological, social, and economic dimensions experienced individually and collectively. While community-based tourism projects have been successful in promoting women's empowerment. A critical aspect of promoting gender equality is the empowerment of women, with a focus on identifying and redressing power imbalances and giving women more autonomy to manage their own lives.Women’s empowerment is vital to sustainable development and the realization of human right for all.ET"

Since time immemorial, quail eggs have been used for a variety of diseases, where the pharmacopoeia has been rather lacking. Working empirically, the ancients had noticed the therrapeutic powers of this little egg. In China, quail eggs had already long been used as a remedy for asthma. The latest technological advances and better knowledge of the world of proteins explain and demonstrate how quail eggs work in different ways on respiratory diseases and the immune system. The latest research opens up a broad spectrum for investigation and this little egg still has much to reveal about the treasures it contains…_x000D_
Quail egg is very suitable for human health. They are considered to be the product of animal origin with the most balanced content of proteins, vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Compared to chicken egg, it contains 2.47 % less fat, 5 times more phosphorus (very good for the brain, phosphorus’ action in organism is above all essential to the health of bones and teeth), 7.5 times more iron, 6 times more vitamin b1 (which play a crucial role in growth and the proper functioning of cardio-vascular, digestive and nervous systems) and15 times more vitamin b 2 (which helps to protect nervous system and support growth and tissue repair). The eggs are rich in trace elements: vitamins B12, B9, B5 and also choline which plays an important role in brain development and function and is essential for children and for embryo development in pregnant women. The eggs are also a very good source of minerals such as selenium (32 µg/100 g), phosphorus (226 mg/100 g) and zinc (1.47 mg/100 g).They are rich in vitamin D and high in antioxidants which play a role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer and age-related diseases. The eggs are made up of complete proteins, i.e. they provide the essential amino acids required for the proper development of the organism. And above all, they contain no cholesterol! It seems incredible!_x000D_
The quail eggs are very useful for treatment of different diseases, such as DIABETES, high blood pressure, bronchial asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, spasticcough, urticaria, obesity, various forms of allergy,diseases of liver and kidneys, sexual impotence, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough, sinusitis, tonsillitis, eczema, ulcers, stress and physical fatigue, atherosclerosis, hair loss, osteoporosis, as well as diseases of thethyroid. Quail eggs improv the function of reproduction and breath, positively affects the brain in lymphatic and immune system. It has beneficial use during the pre- and postnatal period, and after surgery and radiotherapy, forms neurons of central nervous system of children, delaying degenerative aging process._x000D_
The wonderful scientific adventure of quail eggs began in 1960, when French quail breeder R. Cordonnier observed gradual disappearance of asthma and dyspnoea in his wife (allergy: feathers, dust, dog hairs), after the regular intake of quail eggs._x000D_
This observation was confirmed by another breeder who successfully tested out the same therapy with those around him_x000D_
This double observation aroused the full interest of Doctor Truffier. in Rochefort, who, by studying a broad sample of patients (5,000 'treatments' proposed in 10 years) observed in his turn therapeutic properties of quail eggs._x000D_
In 1968, his studies first focused on asthma, then on allergic diseases in general: asthma, periodic rhinitis, hay fever, spasmodic tracheitis, conjunctivitis and certain skin diseases (prurigo, eczema, psoriasis).  _x000D_
The results obtained showed success rate of over 70% in adults and 85% in children, and allowed him to publish “A therapeutic approach to allergic diseases through the ingestion of quails’ eggs” in 1969    for which he was to win the Marcel Zara prize. _x000D_
At the same time, the scientist Gérard Lucotte, a Doctor in genetics and specialist in quail eggs, published work on the qualities of quail egg whites against asthma Quail eggs - active principle discovered. He believed that his fundamental works were sufficiently advanced to propose a more acceptable galenical form than raw egg cures. _x000D_
In 1978,  studies of Doctor Truffier incorporated 10 years' experience and observations on patients having followed detailed protocol and strict rules in terms of dosage, clinical and biological surveillance. _x000D_
Two studies of vital significance were also to aid this development. _x000D_
Firstly, that of Lineweaver, who was to reveal a new fraction of albumen, identified by the name 'ovomucoid'._x000D_
A Franco-Belgian scientific team led by Doctor Bruttmann, an expert allergist at the French Ministry of Health, carried out a double blind clinical study versus placebo with 33 allergists; this study confirmed surprising results observed by Truffier (La Médecine Biologique, April 1995)._x000D_
In 1971, Dr Liu discovered that white of quail's eggs contained enzyme inhibitors other than ovomucoid: ovoinhibitors, glycoproteins which are also natural de-inhibitors of serine proteases and have a powerful effect on trypsin._x000D_
In 1990, Canadian study was to show that the ovomucoid in quail eggs had a powerful activity on elastase that acts in a large number of human pathologies._x000D_
In 1994, Dr Takahashi showed that, out of all avian species, the ovomucoid of quail egg whites was the only one capable of inhibiting human trypsin._x000D_
The works of Dr Bruttmann (CHU de Grenoble, 2007) Rapport Vergnaud-2007-activite-trypsine-elastase-humaine - on the stability of ovomucoid and its inhibiting effect on trypsins and the works of Dr Sainte-Laudy, Effect of ovomucoide on human basophile activation were to follow, which added to many scientific publications._x000D_
Nowadays, anti-allergy properties of quail eggs are being studied in several major universities and high-level research centres. Constant progress in biotechnology has given us a clearer understanding of mechanisms involved in action of quail eggs and of their outstanding properties, and has scientifically confirmed remarkable clinical results observed in the past among several thousand people suffering from allergic symptoms._x000D_
An average egg weighs approximately 20 g; the calorie content of an egg is 30.6 calories (Kcal). 100 g of quail eggs therefore contain 153 calories (Kcal). Quail eggs are a choice food as they have an excellent nutritional value. Their nutritional input per 100 g is 13 g of protein, 11 g of fat and 0.5 g of carbohydrates. As the eggs are low in carbohydrates, they have no glycaemic load (GL = 0). Their high protein content and zero GL therefore mean that they are suitable for inclusion in hyper-protein diets. Quail eggs also have a low cholesterol input (0.8 mg/100 g), which means that they may be recommended for low cholesterol diets._x000D_
Raising quail is fun, interesting and profitable. Quail raising is not expensive, provides very healthy low-fat white meat, and supplies the fertilizer you need for your home garden. Quails are easy to raise and housing required is not as complicated as for chickens. A large number of birds can thus be raised in a very small space. You can raise 6 to 7 quails in the same place that is required for one chicken. The birds do not easily contract fowl diseases common to poultry, especially chickens. So risks are less. Vaccination is not needed and the drugs usually given to chickens do not have to be added. Quails grow very fast and gain maturity faster than any other poultry birds._x000D_
In Benin people don’t know much about quail eggs. 90% of the population of Benin are illiterate. In the villages there are no electrisity. This means that newspapers, flyers, internet and TV are not available for most of the people. The only possible TECHNOLOGY of marketing in far villages is a radio. By our project we are going to explain on rural radio how quail egg is useful.  Marketing TECHNOLOGY also provides by distribution of 2,000  flyers in citys. The DESIGN of flyers  will include a table containing recommendations on use of this eggs._x000D_
  Then we are going to train women in quail egg production. The training will apply the TECHNOLOGY of quail egg production described in 2002 by Doctor of Agricultural Sciences Afanasev Grigory. We are also going to supply women of all that needed to start this business. For purification TECHNOLOGY  of cages we will instole easily removable tray. It will allowd to use bird droppings as a garden bio fertilizer. Since our NGO fighting for environmental protection we are going to use very special TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN of packaging. The quail egg packaging will be braided with straw. Plastic packaging pollute. For production of cardboard pallets trees are destroyed. The straw basketare always availible and decomposes rapidly.Their price is twice cheaper than for plastic ones. From the other side it will give more work for braiders. For eggs are not to be broken, we are going to place several rods as diameters, so the eggs will not tuch each other._x000D_
 It is a very promising project. As quail eggs are smaller in size, so the price is also lower than other bird’s egg, all types of people can buy this eggs and you can easily sell it.  If you raise 100 layers with 70% egg production there will be 70 eggs a day. The birds will consume 2 kg of feeds a day; say 300 FCFA . If the eggs are sold at 25 FCFA each, there will be 1,750 FCFA from daily sales, this means 1,450 FCFA profit daily. Multiply this by twice or thrice the number of layers. Won’t it be nice additional income? Why don’t we start it?",By December 2015 we aim to educate 50 women with our training program in breeding quail and in quail egg production. By February 2016 many people will start to consume quail eggs. It is expected that 50 of those trained women will go on to develop small businesses or pursue further specialized education. It is expected that by May 2016 many people will be treated from several diseases and the families of those 50 women will have stable revenue.

2015,196,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,,Media Advocacy Program: Young Human Right Journalists,Women Empowered Afghanistan,Afghanistan,Afghanistan,0,,[''],"The Media Advocacy Program for Young Human Rights Journalists is a project aimed at reducing domestic violence against women and girls and promoting human rights and democracy in Afghanistan. _x000D_
Afghanistan is home to an agrarian, traditional and deeply religious society. Most of the inhabitants of the country, especially women, have little access to domestically produced independent information that voices their concerns.  In most regions, there are no daily newspapers and, except for foreign radio stations such as the BBC, Radio Azadi, and Voice of America, there exists only an Afghan government-affiliated TV station and several small FM stations that offer only music broadcasts and limited daily news.  Religious and cultural barriers restrict most women from leaving their homes, and illiteracy prevents most women from accessing print or on-line media. Violence and extremism further prevent women from gaining access to education and jobs and participating in socio-economic activities. The lack of educated people in human rights in the media leaves local religious extremists to fill the vacuum—to spread propaganda that insists on an extremely limited and subordinate role for women in society. One of the pillars of intervention by the global community into Afghanistan in 2001 was the promotion of women’s rights. Although some progress has been seen unfortunately women are still target of violence and domestic abuse. This Program aims to train young journalists to increase their knowledge of women’s rights and democracy and place them in the local media so that they can design, implement, and perpetuate journalistic programming that increases public awareness of women’s rights, girls’ education, and human rights and democracy. This project will simultaneously enhance the ability of young people to get jobs, following graduation from this program, in media channels and in organizations that support women’s rights._x000D_
 _x000D_
The Media Advocacy Program will take place over a 6-month period in Kabul, Afghanistan. It will aim to train 15 young women or men - six from Kabul and 1 from each other province of Afghanistan - selected, based on an entry test and application, from university students and recent graduates from across the country. We will distribute brochures in the journalism and law and human rights departments at universities to publicize the Program.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The 6-month program will be divided into multiple units.  _x000D_
•	During the first two months, the participants will be taught about journalism and human rights with a focus on women’s rights.  _x000D_
•	During the third month, the participants will intern at Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission or a similar women’s rights groups or institution, during which the students will work with human rights practitioners to gain a direct, hands-on understanding of the legal status of women in Afghanistan and the role of the government. _x000D_
•	During the fourth month, the participants will intern at a radio, newspaper, or television media outlet in Afghanistan, where students will work with seasoned reporters, producers and technicians to learn about technical issues, write reports, and copy-edit. _x000D_
•	During the last two months, the young journalists will develop and produce an independent report for submission to the Project Manager and then, through him, to potential media outlets. _x000D_
The project’s overall goal is to train young journalists in Afghanistan to use the media to increase public awareness of women’s rights and to advocate against domestic abuse of women and girls._x000D_
_x000D_
The specific objectives include:_x000D_
1. To equip young journalists with the necessary tools and knowledge to promote women’s rights through media and journalism._x000D_
2. To build the capacity of media in Afghanistan to include pro-women’s rights news in their broadcasts._x000D_
3. To advocate for women’s rights and gender equality as part of a holistic human rights based approach to strengthen civil society and to raise awareness of human rights and democracy in Afghanistan. _x000D_
4. To educate youth in the role of the media in a democratic society and to provide job opportunities in the future for these young university graduates, simultaneously reducing the youth vulnerability of joining insurgency.","By December 2017, we aim to train 500 to 600 women's rights journalists. These journalists will be majority female journalists to occupy media and use the journalistic programming to raise the awareness of women's rights through media advocacy and programs in Afghanistan.","Human Rights Watch wrote in 2014 that human rights in Afghanistan had regressed and that the women’s rights situation is dire. In this country of 30 million people entrenched in conflict for four decades, WEA employs a unique approach to train and enable community activists to shift societal norms. While many NGOs provide material goods, WEA’s projects instigate lasting change by promoting women’s participation in society, equal rights, and nonviolence toward women. WEA’s projects will empower women to improve their own lives. For example, our Media Advocacy Program will train young human rights journalists and activists, with a focus on young women, to use the media to increase public awareness of women’s rights. The program will serve participants’ direct needs by developing their professional capacities, while enabling them to promote lasting societal change via their access to media platforms. WW"

We collaboarte over the internet and design content that can be used in global classrooms to get children think critically!

Further, it is more depressing that some cultures don't let girl kids go out and get education which opens new windows, allows perspective, some scope to experiment and new horizons to chase.

The product will be developed in collaboration with Lira District Health Educators, who played the role of carrying out a feasibility study, research on product development and assessment of its impact to the girls and women. The goal of the enterprise is to empower the vulnerable girls and women through provision of reusable pads and capacity building on menstrual hygiene management and reproductive health for improved performance and self esteem. This will be done through production and distribution of reusable sanitary pads as well as ensuring provision of menstrual hygiene management education and facilities to adolescence girls in primary schools in northern Uganda. By acquiring knowledge on menstrual hygiene management, the overall health status of the girls will be enhanced as myths and misconceptions that surround puberty and menstruation will also be demystified.The ability of women and girls to generate income and own assets to ensure food security, material well-being and social status is very weak in the project area. Thus the project will serve about 4,000 women and girls annually which translate to about 1%. Through the proposed activities in this programme, additional 10,000 girls will be reached. The activities proposed will increase the distribution in that 100 schools in Lira northern Uganda will be targeted directly. This implies that about 10,000 girls will be reached directly while additional girls will be reached through the various channels like radio promotions using the local vernaculars apart from the women and girls who will be reached indirectly through the word of mouth from the project beneficiaries.","When the health clubs, senior men and women teachers in schools have embraced the I-Care concept especially the Red manual Booklet (information booklet on menstrual hygiene and reproductive health issues and rights developed using cartoons and graphics) discussions, myths and taboos surrounding the menstruation will be addressed. Pupils and students will receive information about menstrual hygiene management (MHM), about biological facts and practical ways of managing blood flow in a hygienic and discrete way. Through the knowledge that the beneficiaries will get through the programme, more awareness and capacity enhancement on natural family planning methods will be reinforced. Also by focusing MHM education towards both boys and girls, this will foster more understanding attitudes and decreased social stigma in schools.","About 65% of women and girls in northern Uganda cannot afford sanitary pads. Evidence suggests that the period around puberty is one in which many girls drop out of school or are absent from school for significant periods of time. This means that over 850,000 girls miss 6 weeks of school every year and women miss valuable work hours. Menstruation causes Ugandan adolescent girls to lose an average of 3.5 million learning days per month (Move, 2011). Limited access to safe, affordable, convenient and culturally appropriate methods for dealing with menstruation has far reaching implications for rights and physical, social and mental well-being of many adolescent girls in northern Uganda. It undermines sexual and reproductive health and well-being and has been shown to restrict access to education. Meanwhile, the current health expert’s assessment estimates that one in 10 Ugandan adolescent girls miss school during menses and eventually drop out because of menstruation related issues. BA"

Most of the farm holdings which are three to five acres are over-cropped. 

Eight out of every ten youth in Mubende lack gainful employment. They lack knowledge and skills to invest into innovative agro-enterprises like the one project in this project. The few engaged in productive agriculture have never explored value addition and the related chain of agro-product development and marketing.

Due to the tough economic situation and need to survive, many women and young girls are coerced into sex trade for survival and this has caused a rise in HIV/AIDS infection. In addition, cross generational sex is becoming a common practice where older men are seeking younger girls with the aim of avoiding the HIV virus, yet most of these men are already infected. This has resulted to higher prevalence rate of HIV among girls aged 13-19 years ten times higher than in males of the same age bracket.-E"

Market research and data collection – This will involve both primary and secondary research. The Agriculture economics department at Egerton University and ACRE Africa will work closely in understanding weather patterns in the tea growing zones of Kenya. ACRE Africa will collect incidence reports and historical Data collection which will involve field visits to Tea Research Foundation and Tea Factories. The university will carry out quantitative and qualitative research in the tea growing zones to understand all risks faced by the entire tea value chain. _x000D_
_x000D_
Product design – Data analysis and consolidation will follow which will be led by AB consultants and ACRE Africa on the non-weather and weather related risks respectively. This will involve index generation to capture loss from Frost, drought and hail and getting feedback on index from ground to understand better loss years picked by the index and improvement of correlation. From this we will price a product that meets needs established in the market research as well as willingness and ability to pay. _x000D_
_x000D_
Marketing & Distribution Plan – in this phase, we will design methods and materials that will enable the product reach the market. This will involve speaking to existing associations that bring the tea industry together, developing an IT platform and a consumer education strategy. _x000D_
_x000D_
Market testing – After developing the product the next step will be to carry out a controlled pilot in a few areas over a period of 4 months to get a feel of how the market will react to the programme. We will test uptake, distribution network and the impact the product will have on the tea pickers and the entire value chain.","During the first 2 years of the project, we will aim to have a coverage ratio of at least 50%, meaning that at least half of all tea pickers (350,000) in Kenya should be covered by this innovation, impacting almost 2 million lives. Once take up has happened, we will also measure the active rate and persistency ratio which will help us understand how many of our clients are still active which will also help us measure the rate of consumer understanding.","Kenyan tea pickers work long hours on their feet all day often in harsh weather. They face exposure to pesticides and insecticides, are prone to injuries or illness, and typically allowed no breaks. During a weather related risk, they are plunged deeper into poverty.

No insurance has developed any formal coping mechanisms when any of the risks above happen, despite this being a recurring event every year. They have largely been left out of the financial system due to several factors including their casual nature of work and inability of insurance companies to innovate.



We look to address the plight of tea pickers by providing protection during the period of risk, which happens about 3-4 months per year. Our innovation plans to provide a loss of income cover, which would guarantee them income even during the period of risk. This entails developing a risk financing mechanism during the time when their income is high, and provides a loss of income during the time of drought or frost.WT"

2015,186,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,,'Now I can Feed My Kids' Project (Empowering 500 rural young widows with Sustainable Livelihoods Activities),Deborah Eunice Help Foundation (DEHFO),Nigeria,Nigeria,0,,"['Health', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","'Now I can Feed my Kids' (NIFK) Project  is designed to mobilize, assess, train and settle 500 young widows between the age of 25-45 years into various incoming generating activities that are sell-able, useful, marketable and consumable in five (5) communities in Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo State._x000D_
Through this project, young widows will have access to revolving sub-grants to kick-start profitable livelihoods activities and empower others through thesame revolving loans within the space of three (3) months. They will have access to the use of their simple mobile phones for reaching of new customers and expanding their business tentacles even in their immediate communities. As a result of this fund, young widows will be trained and empowered as peer leaders to educate other young women on income-generating opportunities, healthy-habits, the need for increased access to reproductive health information and the need for collective stance against risky cultural practices against women, such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), dogmatic religious beliefs against health-seeking habits and women discrimination in decision-making._x000D_
_x000D_
The project will:_x000D_
_x000D_
(i) Increase the capacity of 500 young widows (25-45 years) to kick-start and sustain income-generating activities in their respective communities through livelihoods' training workshop before February 2016._x000D_
_x000D_
(ii) Settle thirty-six (36) young widows into self-sustainable income-generating activities within the space of 12 months, with an equal number reached in another space of 12 months with little or no interference by the project team._x000D_

It will state the objectives, activities, Logical Framework, performance indicators, strategies for realization, tools to be used, relevant stakeholders to perform the roles, means of evaluation and verification. It will be developed by the project team and to be done with the approval by Project Inspire._x000D_
_x000D_
iv. Development of tools and trainees’ capacity building handbooks:  The training for the young widows shall focus on:_x000D_
 a. Saving culture by the young widows: Widows shall be trained on how they can maintain consistent savings in their respective communities despite the absence of commercial banks and how such savings can be maximized profitably._x000D_
_x000D_
b. Transforming their vegetable farming from subsistence to commercial farming. It will focus on how they can consistently make profit from their vegetable farming irrespective of the weather conditions._x000D_
_x000D_
c. The use of Technologies (mobile phones, computer and digital camera) to expand markets for their business. Young widows will be trained on the use of their phones as a marketing tool to meet new customers and expand their business. They will be trained on the use of their phones and computer to generate 'bulk-SMS' to reach their buyers/end-users and open new local and international platforms to sell their products (online sales/marketing).  Young widows will also be trained on the use of digital camera for taking of photographs for commercial purposes. A list of other 400 livelihoods activities will be generated and listed for the young widows during their training._x000D_
d. The use of their mobiles and computers to acquire information about their government, local news and international news and opportunities which can help enhance their living._x000D_
500 copies of the training handbook will be developed to reach the 500 young widows targeted._x000D_
_x000D_
iv. Community Resources’ Mobilization and Reviewing exercises:_x000D_
This shall be achieved through mapping out community assets using Spatial Assets mapping, and conduct of research into available livelihood activities in the proposed community/community. This shall include market analysis and pricing structure for income generating activities among others. To conduct study on the community resources, DEHFO shall use Geographic Information System (GIS) allows data about assets and needs to be combined and analyzed together thereby potentially eliminate the dichotomy between the two approaches. _x000D_
_x000D_
By the end of this specific action, DEHFO would derive a comprehensive list of community’s opportunities and livelihood resources; physical, social, economic, political and religious that will be made use of as opportunities to be effectively maximized for the development of the community as well as the risks and threats involved or available in achieving such tasks. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
v. Young Widows sensitization and  training on sustainable livelihoods activities:_x000D_
_x000D_
There is the need to follow-up social and resource mobilization exercise with practical Young Widows training and guide to maximize the identified opportunities. These shall be done through:_x000D_
_x000D_
(a) Focused Group Discussions: Young widows shall have specific, non-judgmental and uninterrupted discussion with the project team to itemize their needs, discuss their opportunities and also provide load-down of activities that can enhance their livelihoods. It shall also be a coveted opportunity to provide specific education on new existing opportunities for livelihood enhancement, challenge gender discrimination in all forms and other cross-cutting issues such as HIV/AIDS and other tropical diseases. Through the FGDs, young widows shall itemize the various challenges to business sustainability in their community. The project team shall facilitate these young widows to arrive at solutions to these identified challenges._x000D_
_x000D_
(b) Structured training workshops: These workshops shall be used extensively for sharing information, providing orientation and engaging people in collective reflection, articulation and analysis on livelihoods activities and self-dependency awareness. 100 Young Widows shall be trained in each community on maximizing the identified livelihood activities that are implementable or practicable in their respective communities. The young widows shall have access to livelihoods’ handbooks. _x000D_
The content of the training shall include:_x000D_
- Leadership training: Young widows will have their capacity-built on positive contribution to their immediate environment, through educating other about their sexual and reproductive health rights, health-seeking habits, prevention of Female Genital Mutilation and young widows role in decision-making processes._x000D_
-Saving Culture: Young widows shall be trained on consistent saving and profitable maximization of their saving for income-generating activities._x000D_
- Use of technology: They will be trained on the use of mobile phones to reach new customers, generate BULK SMS, creating of young social-media platforms as a way to strengthen their voice locally and internationally and the use of computer to access information about their government and services._x000D_
- Other income-generating activities: Young widows shall be provided with access to a list of other 100 livelihoods activities that they can sustainable handle within their community._x000D_
_x000D_
(c) Public-Private Partnership:  In mobilizing community dwellers to seek cooperative and participatory actions, community leaders, institutions, Ministry of Women Affairs, the Nigerian Police and Civil Defense Corps as well as the extremely poor are brought into thesame footage to talk their development out irrespective of gender or financial capabilities._x000D_
_x000D_
vi.  Releasing of revolving sub-grants to young widows under the Ten-Empowering-Ten Initiative (TETI):  After the training of these widows, they shall be divided into groups in their respective communities, consisting of ten (10) members per group. The first group, consisting of ten widows each (who specializes in vegetable farming- the most common, yet most profitable grassroots business for widows, cloth-weaving, liquid and solid-soap business and selling of food-stuffs etc.) shall be empowered with $1250 each. They will be expected to return the $1250 each to empower another group after three months. This will be easily achieved as the next-in-line group will be linked to the already empowered group for monitoring and follow-up._x000D_
_x000D_
Sustainability of the Project:_x000D_
This project will sustain itself through:_x000D_
_x000D_
(i) The release and rotation of the young widows start-up funds for widows every three (3) months: Every ten empowered young widow under the ten-empowering-ten initiative will be expected and succinctly monitored to empower another ten widows after three (3) months, by returning the start-up fund given to them, in order to empower others. With this, 40 young widows should be settled for livelihood businesses within the space of 12 months, but in possible case of 4 defaulters, settling 36 young widows within 12 months will be termed a success._x000D_
_x000D_
(ii) Year after year, through thorough monitoring by DEHFO team, at 36 young widows will be settled through the same fund.","The focus of this project is succinctly enumerated below:Overall Goal:_x000D_
•	To promote community acceptance and increase local relevance of young widows in their immediate communities._x000D_
Objectives:_x000D_
•	To increase 500 young widows understanding of their innate abilities as well as immediate environmental resources and opportunities within their environment to acquire sustainable livelihoods for themselves._x000D_
_x000D_
•	To thirty six (36) settle young widows’ into income generating activities using a Ten-Empowering-Ten Initiative (TETI) to consistently provide revolving start-up funds for entrepreneurial widows within 12 months._x000D_
_x000D_
•	To promote sustainable structural care (psycho-social and healthcare) and support for young widows through partnership with state and non-state agencies such as the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and communities stakeholders in non-judgmental and non-discriminating manners in Ondo State._x000D_
","Problem:Young widows are rapidly increasing in Nigerian communities due to short life-span, increase in environmental and mechanical hazards (such as floods, diseases outbreaks, vehicle and motorcycle accidents). Motorcycle accidents especially have claimed more lives recently in Ondo State due to increase in use of motorcycle for economic purposes by young married men and boys, being a substitute for joblessness.

Ondo State has over 1,200,000 motorcycle riders known as 'Okada riders', with only 2 percent using safety precautions (like helmet) while riding (State Traffic Reports, 2013). 



Many young widows emanate from these factors and are subjected to:



(i) Hardships in economic survival and care for their kids.



(ii) Take-up of sexually-risky activities (such as street-hawking) and exposing themselves to HIV/AIDS and other STIs.



(iii) Subjection to harmful cultural practices and maltreatment.



(iv) Inability of young widows to sustain their local businesses.

2015,185,NP,Nepal,NP,Nepal,NP,Nepal,NP,Nepal,,Female Human Trafficking Survivors Create Social Change,Samrakshak Samuha Nepal (SASANE),Nepal,Nepal,0,,[''],"My idea is to leverage and support SASANE's innovative, grassroots effort to empower human trafficking survivors by training them to become tour guides and hospitality staff, so they can have access to the resources and gain the economic benefits of the rapidly growing tourist industry in Nepal. My idea fits best in the 'design for economic empowerment of women and girls'.SASANE has its volunteer guesthouse and office located in Pokhara, Nepal. It is centrally located for easy access to many cultural and fascinating 'must-see' sights around Pokhara, such as:_x000D_
1. Fewa Taal (Lake)_x000D_
2. Barahi Mandir (Temple)_x000D_
3. World Peace Pagoda_x000D_
4. Davi's Fall_x000D_
5. Gupteshwor Gufha (Cave)_x000D_
SASANE will work in the collaboration with G Adventures, a small-group adventure travel experts (website: www.gadventures.com) where they will send their travelers to visit the organization. Survivors then would take G Adventures travelers on half-day tours either in the morning or afternoon for approximately 3 and half hours, which would include walk and cab rides to the 'must-see' sights listed above._x000D_
Before or after each half-day tour (as an included or optional activity, depending on the itinerary), the G Adventures travelers would visit SASANE's guesthouse for a delicious home cooked pre-set lunch of authentic, traditional Nepali food (including vegetarian and meat dishes). The survivors would interact with the travelers by sharing recipes and by demonstrating how one of the most famous dishes in Nepal, mo:mos (traditional Nepali dumplings), is made. Travelers can take turns trying to make mo:mos, which for a  seemingly simple dish, are quite difficult to make. _x000D_
The first priority in the program would be organizing English language classes for the survivors. The English language classes would be run by a TOEFL certified teacher. The language class will include English conversation skills and ability for them to understand the questions asked by the travelers. There are already a few survivors whose English skills are very good. Then, the survivors with the best English language skills (as determined by their English teacher) could apply to be part of the tour guide and hospitality training program._x000D_
The G Adventures CEOs (who already have lead tours through Pokhara) assist in the tour guide training by conducting the half-day tours, while the survivors 'shadow' the CEOs. This would allow the survivors to learn critical 'on the job' skills (i.e. keeping travelers to a set schedule, organizing tickets to the sights, answering travelers questions, etc). As these CEOs likely know Hindi and potentially Nepali as well, they can assist with any language barrier issues that may arise with travelers while the survivors are 'in-training'. _x000D_
Over time, the survivors with the most tour guide and hospitality experience will train new survivors so the tour guide and hospitality training program can become sustainable (SASANE's paralegal training program is currently run this way; the new paralegals are trained by more experienced paralegals)._x000D_
In summary, the $25,000 Project Inspire grant would be used to:_x000D_
1.	Organize English language classes for the survivors;_x000D_
2.	Organize tour guide and hospitality training for the survivors;_x000D_
3.	Upgrade the kitchen facilities in SASANE's guesthouse;_x000D_
4.	Transportation for the survivor girls;_x000D_
5.	Monitoring and Evaluation. _x000D_
My idea will reach out to the vulnerable women, who are at risk of re-trafficking, and provide them with education, training and employment. Each survivor deserves the opportunity to achieve her individual dream and potential. By providing survivors with the opportunity to become tour guides and hospitality staff, they will gain the self-esteem, skills, knowledge, experience and economic independence they need to become leaders in whatever field they choose to pursue. ","After the selection of the girls, the first priority would be organizing English language classes for them. The language class will be of four months which will include: greetings, minor conversation skills, understanding traveler's questions, etc. Then, we will have the tour guide and hospitality training which will be of four months too starting immediately after the English language classes. After the training we will have the guesthouse and kitchen upgraded with the needed gadgets, cooking utensils, cutlery, serving plates, cups, glasses, etc. Finally the G Adventures travelers will start to visit for lunch. In summary, we will start the program from January 2016. For the first month we will have the selection of girls for i.e. the paralegal and the tour guide and hospitality training program. From the second month, we will start the English language classes starting from February till May. Then, soon from the mid week of May we will start the tour guide and hospitality training.","Each year an estimated 30,000 Nepali girls are tricked, coerced, or abducted by the traffickers into sexual slavery or forced labor. In Nepal, traffickers often target girls and (or their families) in rural communities who are impoverished, uneducated and lack opportunities. The girls have little to no education or employment opportunities and are often between 14-25 years old or younger. These young girls are then forced to work as prostitutes in brothels or forced labor until they are too sick to work. Months or years later, some of these girls are rescued, escape or somehow manage to survive. They are Nepal's survivors.My idea targets and supports these survivors by training and empowering them to become tour guides and hospitality staff, so they can have access to the resources and gain the economic benefits of the rapidly growing tourist industry in Nepal. This idea will reach out to these vulnerable women who are also at risk of re-trafficking.  TF"

Men who in Kanungu as in  most such communities hold the majority of social, political and economic capital  can with the right information and skills empower adolescent girls with correct SRHR knowledge and more importantly promote an enabling environment for girls to exercise their Sexual and Reproductive Health rights and responsibilities._x000D_

Ekikoome Initiative:_x000D_
The “EKIKOOME” is a traditional fire side chat that has been around for millennia, where men gather in the evenings after a long day’s work to share a drink, a joke, business ideas, family troubles and together charge forth in life. This is considered a safe place where even the most uncomfortable topics are discussed, opinions challenged and new ideas and thoughts nurtured.  Using this already existing platform we will work with trained facilitators to engage both the older and younger men on SRHR issues affecting their daughters, sisters, wives, girlfriends and nieces with particular emphasis on contraceptive access and use._x000D_
_x000D_
How Ekikoome works:_x000D_
1.	Open Forum-While Ekikoome is informal, the facilitator is intentional about stirring the agenda using topics developed by InPact to provoke participants to think about SRHR responsibilities, consequences to the community but especially on adolescent girls._x000D_
2.	Knowledge and Strategies-At the Ekikoome, we raise awareness, use the safe space to address myths, misconceptions, learn correct information and develop simple techniques to approach these issues (SRHR, including access to and use of contraceptives, and teenage pregnancy) with the girls and women in their communities._x000D_
_x000D_
3.	Commitment-With time the men are encouraged to make a commitment and draw up a work plan of activities, steps they will take to raise awareness, participate in behaviour change campaigns, promote girls sexual reproductive health, rights and responsibilities. The men start in their homes and work through their circles of influence in their communities to create change._x000D_
_x000D_
4.	Capacity- InPact reaches out to other players in the area to generate and advocate for an enabling environment including policies, services, education and opportunities that supports safe sexual and reproductive health for young people especially girls._x000D_
_x000D_
5.	Gender Integration: Women and girls from within these communities are also invited to participate in the Ekikoome. This allows for their opinions and suggestions to be heard in a safe environment, and for interaction with their male colleagues to be facilitated._x000D_
_x000D_
","By August 2015, we aim to have trained 10 young ambassadors (5 female, 5 male) in Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights community awareness and dialogue facilitation._x000D_
By August 2016 we aim to have equipped up to 28,560 men and women directly with SRHR information and skills through the Ekikoome Sessions._x000D_

By April 2016, we aim to have up to 17 men action groups directly advocating for better quality SRHR services for adolescent girls. It is expected that these action groups made up of community leaders will engage up to 30 service providers to better equip adolescent girls with SRHR information and skills._x000D_
","Teenage pregnancy and its associated risks is a big contributor to the high maternal mortality rates in Uganda. One in four teenage girls aged between15 and 19 years is already a mother or pregnant with her first baby (UBOS and Macro International Inc 2011). Up to half of the two million pregnancies that occur every year in Uganda are unplanned and as a result, about 400,000 are aborted, with 90,000 of them resulting in severe complications. (The Independent newspaper, Feb 2014). 

In Kanungu district in rural South Western Uganda, the situation is particularly concerning. Current district statistics indicate that up to 56% of unplanned pregnancies are associated to adolescent girls. Of the documented health facility post abortion care clients served in 2014 alone, 83% were adolescent girls below the age of 30 years, (Kanungu District Health Office Annual Report 2014).

2015,182,BD,Bangladesh,BD,Bangladesh,BD,Bangladesh,BD,Bangladesh,,HELP (Health Education for Less-privileged People),Sayapath,Bangladesh,Bangladesh,0,,['Health'],"With USD 25,000 the 2- year project- “HELP” likes to improve health of disadvantaged and less privileged rural women through health education and access creation to health service provisions. As grass root women are not aware of primary health care, reproductive health, maternity and child health, 87% women are sustaining with health hazards with increasing child mortality rate at 21% in riverine communities of Tushbhander Union of Kaliganj Upazila in Lalmonirhat District, Bangladesh. As the communities are almost river basin, there is an incommunicable context from service catchment areas that makes them grossly deprived from service provisions. The proposed project will improve health knowledge through awareness and skills development by empowering women through developing 100 health institutions/ women groups and leadership comprising 2000 grass root women in riverine communities. It will develop health awareness through 4 campaigns at public places and weekly meeting in these groups at community level for knowledge management. It will develop skills through a daylong health care training tailored for 2000 grass root women. It will develop awareness building on maternity and child health through 2- daylong skills development training for 200 pregnant mothers. It will also develop awareness and skills on reproductive health through meeting and training on improved hygiene for adolescent girls. Here, the project will provide 2-day long training on reproductive health and personal hygiene for 300 adolescent girls.The proposed project- HELP will create greater access to service provisions by developing Public-Private-Partnership between community women groups developed and public and private health service sectors. The Fund will be utilized for developing effective networks and advocacy with such service sectors for sustainable service provisions. Besides it will be used for health service provisions through regular treatment, medicine support and referring to health clinics at District level for operational and clinical support. For this, the project will deploy a physician for treatment and provide medicine support. For an emergency, it will refer the patients to hospital and clinics at district level for operational and better treatment. _x000D_
As service sustainability is indispensible in river basin communities especially the grass root women whether they are deprived from gender discrimination. Their deprivation happens for disempowerment for such discriminations. Service institutions, on the other hand, are not instrumental for service delivery for lacking good governance. Promoting sustainable service provisions the project will develop good governance of health service sectors by creating accountability, transparency and responsibility. For this the proposed project will create civic engagement by developing effective networks between grass root women and civil society groups that will ensure sharing service information. For this, civil society group will be the Watchdog on service delivery of health service institutions that will create a sustainable service delivery social mechanism for grass root women._x000D_
Finally, the project HELP will help grass root women educate health care by empowering themselves and it will ensure health services through institutionalization, capacity building, awareness and skills development, and civic engagement and access creation to sustainable service provisions. The fund USD 25000 will be utilized for empowering 2000 grass root women for protecting their health rights, health awareness building and skills development and health service delivery e.g. treatment and medicine support for two years._x000D_
","100 women institutions are developed in the communities during 1st month of the project and they practice health care by knowledge sharing through weekly meeting during the project time-line (from 1st month to 24th month), it is expected that out of 2000 women, health hazards are reduced amongst 1500 women.It is expected that 1700 grass root women are aware of and skilled in primary health care, reproductive health and maternity and child health with the trainings provided by December 2016._x000D_
10 Civil society groups are expected to engage with 100 women groups by 4th month of project time-line and they will oversee health service provisions._x000D_
5 public and 3 private sector health service institutions are expected to deliver services and it is expected that 1700 women avail health services during 5th month to 24th month of the project time-line._x000D_
Service sector- Women group- Nexus is developed in the communities resulting in a sustainable health service delivery amongst disadvantaged women.","Grass root women in riverine communities of Tushbhander Union of Kaliganj Upazila in Lalmonirhat District, Bangladesh have been sustaining health hazards since the long for unawareness, extreme poverty and discriminations. They are not aware of primary health care, nor could they avail health care support from public and private sectors as they are grossly deprived for unawareness of service policies and gender discriminations as well. As a result, 87% grass root women are sustaining with health hazards with effete livelihoods. Health hazards refrains from involvement in income generation and thus could not contribute to families and society resulting in extreme poverty, vulnerability and violence against the women. For unawareness and malnutrition, 67% women and 73% girls bear hazardous maternity and reproductive health and thus child mortality increases at 21% in the grassroots. They are deprived from health service provision for disempowerment keeping them at hazardous livelihoods. TT"
2015,181,UG,Uganda,UG,Uganda,UG,Uganda,UG,Uganda,,West Nile Community-Based Agriculture Improvement Project,Abi Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute,Uganda,Uganda,0,,[''],"Agriculture is arguably the most important sector of the Ugandan economy, employing 73 percent of the population aged 10 years and older; with the proportion of women employed in agriculture higher (83%) than for men (71%). The National Development Plan (NDP II) Strategy of Uganda that focuses toward “increasing household income and promoting equity” recognizes agriculture as a primary source of growth in Uganda. The Strategy seeks to assess this objective by measuring changes in agricultural production and productivity; among other things. At policy level, agriculture is at the center of the national development agenda. There is general consensus that agriculture can and does play a significant role in raising household incomes, providing employment and contributing to overall economic growth. The Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and Investment Plan 2010/11-2014/15 of the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries of Uganda also targets to improve household food and nutrition security.  The West Nile Community-Based Agriculture Improvement project will be implemented by Abi Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute (ZARDI) among grass-root farming communities – targeting women groups – in the North Western region of Uganda (commonly called West Nile Region). Whereas Abi ZARDI serves the entire West Nile region of Uganda consisting of eight districts, the project will focus its activities in grass-root communities located in the three districts of Adjumani, Nebbi and Yumbe. These are communities where the per capita consumption is quite low, way below the internationally accepted USD 1.25 a day. Over 80% of the community members depend on agriculture for their livelihood yet crop yields in these areas are low (only about 30% of the potential yield of improved varieties). Key factors contributing to this low yield include, use of poor quality seed that are low-yielding and less-tolerant to diseases; use of bad agricultural practices that deteriorate soil health; lack of access to proper extension services and information for better agricultural production. In these communities, about 23.2% of the population has never attained any level of formal education, with women forming the greatest percentage (17.8%); hence the level of poverty is much higher than the national average (24.5%). _x000D_
In each of the selected districts, two sub counties will be identified in a participatory manner, involving all key stakeholders. A key consideration to be made while identifying groups is that all members should be women and/or girls. Each group should consist of 30 members who have at least an acre (2.5 ha) of land for the group’s joint learning activities and seed multiplication. Besides the group farmers field, each member of a group will be required to have at least half an acre of an individual field for personal/family agricultural production purposes. In the group fields, farmer field schools and demonstrations will be conducted by Abi ZARDI technical staff in a participatory manner so as to enable the participating farmers to learn by doing; and later employ the same recommended practices in their individual fields. _x000D_
Farmer capacity building will be done in the areas of agronomy, soil and water conservation, soil fertility improvement, pest and disease management, post-harvest handling, among others. Key topics to be taught will include, but not limited to, seed identification and variety characteristic, seedbed preparation, planting methods and seed rates, plant spacing, and pest and disease control. Trainings will also be conducted on topics such as record keeping, marketing, credits, loans and savings. Abi ZARDI has the required technical capacity to undertake the training through the competent staff in the various disciplines. The group fields will be located close to major community roads so that other non participating members of the community can be able to learn by seeing. A farmer institutional development process will be conducted to each identified group to ensure that issues such as constituting an executive, visioning, group dynamics and cohesion, among others, are handled at the onset of the project. _x000D_
The model crops selected in this project are cassava, groundnuts, rice and improve mangoes due to their importance in the farming system and current demands from farmers. The significance and specific attributes of the selected seed include the following:_x000D_
Cassava (NASE 14): Cassava is number one food and cash crop grown in the West Nile region by every household. NASE 14 variety has been adapted both on-farm and on-station and both scientists and farmers have noted that that it is sweet, produces bigger and straight tubers, and most important of all, it is tolerant Cassava Brown Streak disease, the current severe cassava disease in Uganda. _x000D_
Rice (NERICA 4): Rice is the crop commodity that has recently won the interest of many farmers in Uganda due to its attractive market value. In 2014, the total land area cultivated under rice in West Nile region alone was 1,073.3 ha. Amongst other upland varieties, NERICA 4 is the most adapted upland rice variety in the West Nile region, where the most dominant rice cultivation ecology is rain-fed upland. Special attributes associated with it are high yielding (3-4 t/ha), early maturing (110 days), resistance to rice blast and other cereal diseases, tolerant to drought and has good eating quality. _x000D_
Groundnuts (Serenut 4): Groundnut is the second most important food legume in Uganda. It is a good source of protein and oil in the diet of both urban and rural populations. The current on-farm production of groundnuts in West Nile region is however low because about 75% of farmers are growing local land races that are susceptible to rosette disease resulting into low yields. However, Serenut 4 is early maturing (80-100 days), tolerant to most common groundnut diseases, has a high yield (2.5 t/ha) and it is sweet and soft and thus most preferred by farmers._x000D_
Grafted Mangoes (Kate and Alphonso): In light of promoting sustainable income generation from perennial crops, the government of Uganda is promoting fruit (citrus and mango) production as strategic commodity for the northern and eastern parts of Uganda. This comes along with the indirect benefit of environmental conservation especially through fixing larger quantities of atmospheric carbon (a greenhouse gas) in long term perennial crops. Amongst other mango varieties tested by Abi ZARDI in West Nile region, Kate and Alphonso varieties have adapted well to the West Nile agro-ecological zone and have been preferred by farmers due to their sweet taste, high yield, tolerance to pests and diseases and the attractive market preference. The stated attributes were established by both farmers and scientists and if when promoted are more likely to improve adoption rates, productivity, food security and household incomes. _x000D_
For quality assurance purposes, Abi ZARDI will obtain breeders and foundation of improved seeds of identified crop varieties from National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in case of cassava and rice, while groundnuts will be obtained from National semi-Arid Crops Resources Research Institute (NaSARRI) – research institutes under the National Agricultural Research Organization. Seedlings of the identified mango varieties will be raised locally from within the Institute. An assessment of the bio-physical characteristics of farmer group locations and other relevant needs assessments will be conducted prior to settling on the kind of crop commodity to be allocated for production by each women farmer group. This will be done in order to ensure maximum adoption and returns – in terms of yield performance and income – from the crop commodity allocated to the groups. The participating farmers will be encouraged to bulk and sell their surplus seeds to other indirectly participating farmers, local NGOs and the public. It is expected that through farmer to farmer seed sharing (a common practice amongst farmers in the region) the indirect impact of the project will be wide-spread._x000D_
The major objective of this 2-year (January 2016 to December 2017) project is, therefore, to sustainably improve agricultural production and productivity for improved food security and nutrition, and household income amongst grass-root women farming communities in the North Western region of Uganda. _x000D_
The specific objectives include:_x000D_
i.	To improve crop yields among women farmer groups through promotion of soil fertility improvement and water conservation technologies that are climate-smart._x000D_
ii.	To improve access to quality seeds for grass-root women farmer groups through participatory seed multiplication, and dissemination of improved varieties of cassava, groundnuts, rice and improve mangoes.  _x000D_
iii.	To build the capacity of grass-root women farmer groups in climate-smart agricultural production through trainings in good agricultural practices and climate change._x000D_
iv.	To initiate and strengthen Village Savings and Loan Associations for participating women groups through provision of training on credit and savings. _x000D_
Expected outputs include:_x000D_
i.	Sustainable improvement in crop yields among participating communities with minimum effect on the soil health._x000D_
ii.	Adequate supply of quality seeds of cassava, groundnuts, rice and improve mangoes for subsistence women farmer groups in participating communities.  _x000D_
iii.	Vibrant Village Savings and Loan Associations integrated into farming activities of participating women farmer groups. _x000D_
Key activities include:_x000D_
i.	Project inception meetings and farmer group identification_x000D_
ii.	Baseline survey to establish the current crop yields and socio-economic status of participating farmers_x000D_
iii.	Procurement foundation and breeders’ seeds for multiplication at Abi ZARDI_x000D_
iv.	Distribution of seed to farmers and further seed multiplication by farmer groups_x000D_
v.	Farmer capacity building","The two major result areas that the project commits itself to include the following:_x000D_
1) By December 2017, we target to produce 1,200 bags of cassava cuttings, 8 tons of groundnuts, 12 tons of rice and 5,000 seedlings of improved mangoes for cultivation among the 180 directly participating women farmer groups. It is expected that at 150 farmers of those women will sale surplus produce to generate income for subsequent development of small businesses. _x000D_
_x000D_
2) By December 2017, we aim to form 6 vibrant Village Savings and Loan Associations among beneficiary women groups. It is expected that 4 of those Associations will have a financial portfolio of about USD 1,500 accrued from member contributions and interests; which funds they will borrow to start small business. ","The major problem we want to solve is the low crop yields (only 30% of the potential yield of improved varieties) in the North Western Uganda where over 80% of the population depends directly on agriculture for their livelihood. The low crop yields have resulted in widespread household food insecurity and poor nutrition, particularly in the grass-root communities where most of the agriculture is done by women as a method of supporting their families. This problem has been caused largely due to the lack of access to quality seeds of improved crop varieties, low levels of soil fertility due to continuous cultivation without measures to improve soil fertility, and lack of appropriate extension services to farmers. This problem has a strong impact on the farming community members’ ability to earn from the crops they grow and pull themselves out of poverty. Increases in the value of crops through improved crop yields would have a direct impact on family nutrition and income.WT"

C. Creation of a cooperative arrangement to make the effort self-sustaining in the long run_x000D_
In order to build the capacity of the future members to undertake the responsibilities to run that would be social enterprise arrangement, capacity building training will be given to them on management, financial matters, etc.  At the end of project, CAFÉ VIA will be registered as an independent entity as Social Enterprise (Private Limited Company without dividend sharing) in Nepal._x000D_
_x000D_
Activity 3.1: Nepali Tea Making classes for tourists and foreigners _x000D_
Most of the tourists coming to Nepal love to learn making of different Nepalese dishes. CAFÉ VIA will serve as a training center for tourists and foreigners for tea making course. These courses will run on a periodic basic with some training fee. _x000D_
","•	By December 2016 we aim to educate 30 girls/women with our business and entrepreneurs training program. •	It is expected that CAFÉ VIA will be started and will be upon running by December 2016. _x000D_
•	It is expected that at least three (3) of those girls will go on to owner of CAFÉ VIA by December 2016._x000D_
•	A self-sustained social business will be in place, with the girls/women themselves playing leading role in managing the co-operative arrangement._x000D_
•	Hundreds of jobs will be created for young, less educated women of Nepal in upcoming year through its extension._x000D_
","Migration from rural to urban areas, specifically in Kathmandu is increasing in recent years. Similarly, migration from rural to urban areas by gender is also changing. Except for a few women involved in descent jobs, the majority of women are working in wool-spinning and knitting areas. Furthermore, with increasing trend of growing population the lack of employment opportunity is forcing them to go abroad on least minimum wages. They may get mentally and physically harassed in different ways. Although opportunities for men’s are still in the place but the possibility for women in still far from the current thread of employment creation. 

The irony is while this sad phenomenon happens in front of our eyes, there are endless possibilities of creating Jobs needing very little informal education and entrepreneurs based training within Nepal, at the same time promoting the taste of tea in Nepal. The growing consumer patterns for tea are comfortably placed to pay for such products.••"

This is a true picture of the woman and the girl child in developing countries; with Cameroon inclusive. These and their families represent a substantial proportion of the poor. In order to change the perception that 'poverty is female' we are proposing a project that aims at giving the woman and the girl child a voice within the set devastating  structures of socioeconomic and sustainable development. Implementation of this project will provide the women and the girl child with the opportunity to safety and freedom from violence, and grant them full agency over their bodies, sexuality and reproduction, gender identity and expression. It will also help them to build just economic systems and structures and promote their inheritance and labour rights, economic strategies that build and strengthen sustainable livelihoods and environmental justice. Above all, it will serve to strengthen and sustain women’s collective voice through movement building, using media and popular culture to transform attitudes and behaviours; thereby  protecting dignity and humans from experiencing any form of degrading human treatment.Strategy: A thousand, (1,000) -Young girls and women from 15- 40+ would be made to registered with a sum of twenty thousand francs as the first cycle of beneficiaries. This money shall serve as membership dues and shares into the Women Economic Empowerment Grant Program scheme. Each registered candidate will have a registration card and number assign to her name (VGFBFP001-01-6-2015). This registration code would be used in identifying the beneficiaries. When the process is complete, beneficiaries will be called up to tender for assistance through the ‘VGF – Bank For The Poor’ Though members of the schemes this assistance is given in the form of loan with low interest rate of 2-2.5% . While doing their regular and daily savings, they are also paying the loan granted to them in the form of assistance through the ‘VGF- Bank for the Poor.’_x000D_

a)	Women become effective and leading leaders in business, own shares and investing in business that yield returns on investment. _x000D_
b)	They become economically independent; empowered to fight and eradicate the twin burden of poverty and violence in their homes. _x000D_
c)	They acquire skills in accounting and management, and are economically empowered. _x000D_
d)	Their erratic disposable household income is increased. They can now create self reliance groups promoting thrift and loans schemes of social reliance within the women network._x000D_

Timeframe: The project is estimated to run for 12months and renewable._x000D_
Indicators and verification means: The project seeks to empower 3,500 women in a year. The number that is empowered with functional offices and operating businesses, will serve as measurement for the goal attainment.  Reports of the number of women trained, established and are successful in using economic grants, videos, attendant sheets, interview granted etc are the means of verification._x000D_
Monitoring and evaluation: Regular field visit, SWOT, audit, and meetings with beneficiaries_x000D_
Budget: The Organisation is requesting the sum of $30,000 = 15,000,000 FCFA for the economic empowerment of 3,500 women from the North West Region of Cameroon. This will enable us attain the goal of empowering 3,500 women economically, collectively and individually by 2016 through the VGF Bank For the Poor. This will be administrated thro Women Empowerment Economic Grant Program (WEEGP) to yield returns in the form of commissions, interests, subscriptions, registrations, insurance, loan repayments, application fees, VAT etc. This money requested is used for business dealing in order to attract profits._x000D_

As APHEDA and LWU partners will also emphasize on poor focus and support the poverty reduction govt. program e.g. food security, livelihood  and income generation through direct skills training for poor women in poor districts (GoL targets) such as hairdressing, tailoring, massage, embroidery, weaving and natural dye, cooking/food processing, housekeeping, hospitality and cooking), animal raising (Chicken/pig). The project will target poor women in Vientiane Capital, Xiengkuang, Luang Prabang.   Besides, APHEDA have provided also additional subject to target trainees to gain more skills after they finished the training courses e.g. gender in development, life skills, reproductive health, HIV/AID/STD prevention, marketing, small micro credit for graduated students to begin their business at home. ","(1) Training places for at least 105 marginalized and poor women access vocational training through 9 separate courses with training places for two hairdressing courses (30 attendees), two life-skills, marketing (30), 3 food processing/cooking (45 attendees). The food processing training will be conducted in villages or District locations convenient for the target groups;(2) It is expected 60 graduated women will run business at home and the rest will find job at the private shop e.g. beauty shops, restaurant. ","As the program will be shifting the focus of assistance to rural poor women, it will help APHEDA and Lao women's union to provide skills training and access more poor women in the rural remote areas and also to help government to empower and increase capacity and implement the poverty reduction project for poor women.

Though meeting the physical needs of the orphans is imperative, we believe' sense of belongingness' is the blessing the orphans seek. To fill this void we facilitate building mother-daughter relationship between orphan girls and destitute elderly widows by housing one-family-on-one-cottage model. As we build the cottages as traditionally built in lndia, without cement and iron rods but with locally available materials, it is less expensive. Twenty eco-cottages would house 20 orphan girls and 20 destitute elderly widows. After 18yrs girls would leave out with entrepreneurial skills and be independent. The settlement generates additional income through eco-social-tourism and as permaculture learning center. After 8-10 years of operation the project will have the capacity to fund a new project. We've raised nearly S5000 through a crowdfunding campaign https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orphansfamily) plus locally. Land is the basic requirement for the project. Even if we could raise enough to buy five acres of land, the project would grow slowly over the revenue earned through agriculture and raising livestock. The raised amount could only get us wasteland in remotest part. But as the project house vulnerable women, considering the leftwing extremist issue, it would be good to get the land somewhere near small town headquarters, for it we require additional $25000.","By the third year of operation 20 orphans girls and 20 destitute elderly widows, would have a facility to learn and cultivate the entrepreneurial capabilities. subsequently every day we would train 3-5 women farmers to effectively improve their agriculture enterprise thus reaching minimum 1000 women farmers in a year.

In Sep 2014, Sapa O’Chau improved its amenities and setup a handicraft showroom. During the same period, the handicraft department was formed to create job opportunities for six. The handicraft business also provide a source of monetary income for craftswomen in the villages in exchange for quality handicraft work. _x000D_
In Jan 2015, Sapa O’Chau opened its representative office in Hanoi to bring in more guests. The business expansion move is to support up to 80 students in the next few years. A plan to acquire land for new boarding and classroom facility is being crafted. There is intention to partner with Hanoi Open University and Capilano University for vocational training so as to secure grants for this new facility._x000D_
_x000D_
With USD25,000 from Project Inspire, USD7,429 will be used for rental of Sapa O'Chau Tour and Cafe facility. This facility is where our 30 trekking guides receive their trekking guests and the story of Sapa O’Chau is shared. USD8,400 will be used for rental of Sapa O'Chau Boarding facility. This is where the 35 village youth stays so that they can attend government highschool during the day and enrichment lessons with volunteers at night. USD9,000 will be used for scholarships of 6 tertiary education female ethnic minority students. These students are selected because of their commitment and belief that education will help improve their lives. The remaining funds of USD171 will be used for purchase of female personal hygiene supplies for the year. This is a basic necessity for hygiene.   _x000D_
_x000D_
Sapa O’Chau will redirect its trekking revenue to its longer term project, the new Sapa O’Chau facility, that would likely incorporate a vocational training component. This facility can then support about 80 students, twice the maximum capacity our current facility can support. This facility would provide stability for Sapa O’Chau as it does not need to worry about finding a new place to rent when its lease is up. The rental locations in Sapa are old and requires heavy investment to maintain the building. They also need to be renovated to make space for classrooms, administrative offices, dining hall, computer rooms and library. Owning this new facility and land, Sapa O’Chau can apply for education centre status. This is the next big step for Sapa O’Chau to increase its reach to ethnic minority youth. The ethnic minority community will view this status as a brand of trust and road to success.","By December 2016, we aim to: educate 20 girls with our boarding program; support 6 girls with tertiary scholarship program; and support 32 female staff with sustainable career. ","Sapa is a popular tourist destination in northern Vietnam. This has attracted many businessman from the Kinh majority to the area to set up businesses. The ethnic minorities do not benefit much from the tourism boom. The income inequality has widen significantly. The ethnic minorities have their own native language and they have to learn Vietnamese and English in order to work for the Kinh businesses. The elders are mostly uneducated hence they prefer their children to tend the farm. Education is a long term process which requires monetary investment and travelling at least 10 km from village to town by bad roads. Most ethnic minorities are farming at the subsistence level. To earn money, they have to peddle their traditional handicraft on the streets, sell their little surplus farm produce at the market or find work. Sapa O’Chau is founded by Shu Tan a former handicraft street peddler and tourist guide. She is from the Black Hmong ethnic minority. She has experienced these first hand.BO"

This makes the male take advantage of the women especially the young women thus the increase in child prostitution and to the extreme child scarification, all these issues need to be addressed and ways to curb them needs to be complemented with programs and activities such as, Women and Girl Empowerment Forum that stimulate creativity and critical thinking while developing new knowledge and skills._x000D_
 _x000D_
The Women and Girl Empowerment Forum program tries to address the above mentioned issues, using the formation of groups and leaders amongst themselves.For a long time Uganda has experienced political turmoil owing to the fact that both the leaders and the led do not understand their roles in a democratic society. Quite often people fail to hold their leaders accountable because they cannot link their suffering to the responsibilities and actions of their leaders.  This is the general situation for everyone, but when it comes to women the situation is worsened by the way the leaders perceive the women (as a voter machinery that help them achieve their own selfish objectives, Thus, the women can be used as bargaining chip by encouraging them to vote for candidates that can ably include the affairs of women in their manifestos._x000D_
 _x000D_
By inculcating the democratic principles of freedom of expression, human rights and tolerance, good governance and accountability to the women, (WAGEF) strongly believe that the future generation will enjoy better lives by getting their leaders to do what they are meant to do._x000D_
_x000D_

• For empowerment, the project will tackle issues like social and economic independence for the women._x000D_
• Exchange of information will be paramount in the whole project, WAGEF will partner with organizations that advocate for the rights of women and the media fraternity so as to have a voice that is heard by those far and wide. a website will also be formed and monthly forum will be included in the organization’s calendar.

Gender inequality is also linked to high school drop out of girls leaving most of them resort to prostitution, street begging, early marriages and becoming house girls and victims of human trafficking.

2015,138,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,ID,Indonesia,,Integrating Economic Empowerment into Cultural Preservation for the Indigenous Women of West Borneo,Yayasan Planet Indonesia,Indonesia,Indonesia,0,,"['Environment & Sustainability', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Our project aims to preserve the rich material culture (e.g. handicrafts and art work) of the Indigenous Women of West Borneo, provide an increased income by economically empowering indigenous women, convert degraded lands into community gardens managed by women, and leverage their connection with international buyers and markets. Globalization, environmental degradation, and high levels of poverty are currently severely impacting the indigenous women (Dayak) of Borneo. Historically women weaved products every day with motifs and techniques found nowhere else in the world. Currently, globalization, decreased capacity, and environmental degradation are destroying indigenous rights and culture in West Borneo. We have partnered with a weaving cooperative (which our team members also helped found) that provides training for 1500 dayak women in the Sintang district of West Borneo. Currently, these women are showing decreased quality in their products as they no longer have access to natural dyes. This decreased quality not only causes a decrease in the value (e.g. negative economic impacts) but also causes women to use chemical dyes straying away from their traditional practices. For example, on average an active weaver may produce up to 8 large products a year using chemical dyes yielding a total income of around USD$560. However, using natural dyes, on average, the product’s value will increase by 35-50%. This means that on average a women could increase her yearly income from weaving from around $500 to close to USD $$750. These numbers demonstrate the importance of natural dyes from a purely economic perspective. On a philosophical platform natural dyes more closely preserve the weavers’ customs, cultures, and represent the strong connection that the indigenous people of Borneo once had with the forest. Currently, younger women have expressed they no longer know the techniques needed to create natural dyes. To combat this our team will create recipe books that explain various ingredients and processes needed to produce a desired color. Moreover, although this weaving cooperative grew from just 5 weavers to now over 1500 it currently services only one district and one tribe. Therefore, we have developed an integrated multidisciplinary approach to empower women, increase local capacity, and preserve indigenous culture.For the women in the weaving cooperative we plan to: (i) build an international website to help them sell their products, (ii) provide training in marketing strategies and business techniques, (iii) develop community gardens on degraded lands to increase access to natural dyes, and (iv) create a small book that provides a 'recipe' for women to create a natural dye. Are use of modern technology will help identify new ways for women to obtain natural dyes. Our workshops will resemble mini-chemistry labs were we try different recipes and techniques to achieve the colors desired. Moreover, we will provide marketing training for the cooperative women to help leverage their ability to sell products internationally. For this grant these objectives can be achieved._x000D_
Our long term goal is to replicate our already successful model in the capital city of West Kalimantan (Pontianak). This cooperative will serve as the home of the 'West Kalimantan Craft Network.' This network will not only target women in the Sintang district but throughout the entire region. Coordinating with different ethnic groups and tribes, this center will act as a place of knowledge, sharing, buying and selling. Visitors and tourists can directly purchase their products, but most importantly, women from rural villages can participate in training programs, workshops, and meet other artisans throughout the region to learn how to preserve their local material culture but also contribute to their household financials situation. We believe this integrated approach provides a strong economic incentive for women to engage in the preservation of their local culture.  There are a few other organizations around the world that have used a similar model, however, they are for-profit. They often force artisans to create products that are popular with buyers, giving the artisans specific colors, techniques, and sizes of products. As a non-profit organization we believe this approach only negatively impacts indigenous rights. We put the artisans and the women first. We have no requirements for products made, rather we value each women's technique, motifs, and methods used. We do provide training and act as a facilitator connecting older generation weavers and artisans with younger women. The underlying objectives of our approach support indigenous women's rights, cultural preservation, as well as economic development. The fusion of these field and this multidisciplinary approach creates a revolving system where women are connected, empowered, and preserving their local tribes culture and art work. Together, through innovation, we can create harmony on our planet.  _x000D_

From the expansion of various cultures, many local communities are losing their traditional techniques causing their history and cultural background to become at risk for extinction. Due to a degraded ecosystem, many products have declined in quality as producers have decreased access to forest products that they use for natural dyes and product creation. Our integrated approach is centered on revitalizing tradition artworks, providing community gardens for increased product quality, and developing the 'West Borneo Craft Network' to leverage collaboration, buying, and selling.  In other words, we are mitigating the loss of indigenous culture in Borneo, the impacts of deforestation on women’s rights, and issues of women’s poverty related to indigenous rights. WW"

The method of teaching in Ghana requires children to memorize and not to analyze problems and find  innovative solution to them. Recently Ghana was ranked last out of 76 countries worldwide in mathematics and science by the OECD (The Organization of economics co operation and development) because the test taken to access the ranks was based on analytical thinking and not reproducing what had been memorized. We believe this problem exists because there is a lack of awareness of the importance of a practical STEM education at an early stage of a child's life and the Ghanaian government has also neglected the implementation of a practical STEM curriculum. The long term effect of this problem is stagnant economic growth  and lack of social development. TT

It is imperative that we work towards sensitizing women on their rights and also on improving their access to education, healthcare facilities and to create an environment where they can make independent decisions. Another factor which hinders women’s empowerment is the class divide in India.The women belonging to the lower caste especially tribal communities are very vulnerable;They have neither access to basic education nor any healthcare facilities.

In order to achieve this goal, a capacity building program was designed for 4 young “female puppetry practitioners” to enhance their capability to run a social enterprise and generate revenue. The core social value provided will be impeded in the service that we offer, “a puppet performance which its core theme is based on real improvisations by vulnerable women from different societal backgrounds.” Since the target group of this project is people in general and women in particular we tried to serve as much community areas as we can, therefore the puppet theatre had to be a mobile one; meaning, it is able to challenge any mobility restriction imposed on women and it can reach any marginalized geographic area. Each puppet performance is followed by a debate in which Yt doesn’t provide solutions but raises questions that serve to advocate freedom of expression, and gender equality; however they are also meant to raise awareness about women’s rights and the necessity to proclaim them. Each play will be performed for an audience of 100 people each time (including men, women and kids). Our audience is generally charged with a very small amount of money that is affordable for every family. However, vulnerable people who are unable to pay are also welcome to attend the performances. We believe that this approach will lead to achieve the following specific objectives:  creating a social enterprise led by young women, will serve as a role model to empower women and motivate others as an inspirational approach for generating income and offer a social value. In addition, a mobile theatre that collect women stories from different areas and present them as plays for others will build a sphere of harmony among diversified indigenous folk’s peculiarities of their heterogeneous entourages, making a general understanding and strengthening bonds among them. On the other hand, this mobile theatre will be an effective tool to set a special database for the working group about women different backgrounds.","By the end of 2015:-	20 performances will be performed for different areas including all marginalized areas in Hebron governorate._x000D_

Other livestock include 2.01 million pigs, 35.5 million local chicken and 24.5 million improved chicken (MLFD 2014).  Despite of the large number of cattle available in the country, livestock industry contribution to the national economy is low i.e. 3.8 GDP. This is due to the fact that most farmers in the beef industry produce beef animals traditionally in such a way that meat produced is of low quality compared to the market demand. This leads to short supply of quality meat although the price for such quality meat has been increasing. The short supply of quality meat gives a room for importation of such meat from other countries. The emphasis has been provided by the government on better beef cattle farming by introducing a policy aimed at conducting beef production in a modern way that is commercial and is environmental friendry. Beef cattle keepers are must improved beef cattle through feedloting in which meat value can be added and thus meet the market demand for quality meat. Most of cattle for beef production in Tanzania are indigenous types found in the traditional sector and raised by grazing on natural pastures. Most animals slaughtered in various abattoirs including Arusha Meat Company are not finished for meat value addition (Sichalwe, 2014). This implies that there is a need for education provision into the whole meat value chain in Arusha to explore opportunities for adding value to beef product for increased marketability and income.",improved life standards of pastoralists through raising price of their products and environmental conservation,Selling poor quality meat for lower cost that leads to poverty in the pastoralist communityCA

In-spite of the many interventions made by government and Non-government institutions in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and financing in Uganda has continued to decline. Financing agriculture in Uganda today requires mitigating two principal risks, 1. Production Risk (the probability that the crop may never be harvested) and 2. Price Risk (the probability that cost of production may be higher than market price). These realities discourage financiers from engaging in financing agricultural value chain activitT1"

Through this five year project we will focus our efforts on the transition period from primary to secondary school as this is the period where the dropout rate is higher, many girls are forced into marriage at this stage or experience Female Genital Mutilation. _x000D_
The funding will enable us to carry out the following activities:_x000D_
_x000D_
Improving Access to Education - The project will advocate for the implementation of published educational policy (such as rights to education for child mothers), increased gender sensitive educational budgets and greater community involvement in supporting all children to go to school. At a community level the project will work with traditional leaders, parents, school management _x000D_
committees and Ward Development Committees (WDCs)  highlighting the cultural and socio-economic barriers and risk for children and teachers.  _x000D_

Improving Quality of Education - The project will work with teacher training colleges to support teachers with in-service training – including Math, Science, English. Teachers will be supported in diversifying teaching methods and improving behaviour and participation.  School inspectorates will also be involved in identifying and monitoring quality education across target schools. _x000D_
_x000D_
Improving governance and security of schools - Through setting up a total of 40 girls’ health clubs in 80 schools, the project will provide a forum for students to support each other socially and academically as well as learn about wider health issues including FGM, early and forced marriage, women’s rights and general wellbeing. _x000D_
_x000D_
Improving transition - Transition between primary and secondary schools, especially for girls, lies at the heart of all project outcomes. Previous projects shows a link between factors which impact on transition including increased advocacy on child rights, gender sensitive budgeting, increased quality of education in schools and improved governance and security in schools. Through this project we will support girls through this particular vulnerable transition stage by advocating on a community, local, district, and national level. _x000D_
_x000D_
The effects of our activities will ensure girls are more confident and have better self-esteem which means they do not feel inferior to boys, can decide and negotiate relationships and safe sex and stand up for themselves when it comes to their fundamental rights. Through awareness raising and advocacy attitudes of parents, communities, teachers and local governments will be changed and girl’s rights will be recognised. At a district and national level we will aim to have some influence on policy makers. Furthermore it is important that girls have good quality education therefore teachers and head teachers will be trained and knowledge on child protection and wellbeing increased.      _x000D_

","Tanzania remains a poor country with an education system ranked 143/181 and its gender inequality index is 119/146. At a national level girl’s enrolment is lower than boys, dropout rates are higher and performance is worse. Only primary education is compulsory and Tanzania has the world’s lowest rate of transition from primary and secondary school at 36%. Secondary school girls make up 44.5% of students. Studies find half of girls in secondary school are sexually active. 8,000 girls drop out annually due to pregnancy. 

In pastoralist communities girls are under-represented in primary schools (39% in Ngorongoro, 47% in Longido, 49% in Monduli). Drop-out rates and poor performance are further increased by family displacement, initiation ceremonies (Esoto), Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and early and forced marriage.

","Các xã Tân Thành, Tân Thuận, và Thuận Qúy huyện Hàm Thuận Nam nằm trong danh sách những xã có số lượng người nghèo nhiều nhất trên toàn huyện, phụ nữ trong các gia đình khó khăn luôn là nạn nhân của các vụ bạo hành, đổ vỡ hạnh phúc. Đơn giản là vì họ chỉ ở nhà nội trợ, còn đàn ông mới có thể tham gia làm việc, đem tiền về nuôi gia đình. Vì thế, mọi việc trên dưới trong nhà đều do người đàn ông quyết định, phụ nữ chỉ nghe và làm theo, họ không có bất kỳ vị trí hoặc vai trò gì trong cộng đồng, thậm chí tại gia đình. Bởi không làm ra tiền nên họ không có tiếng nói trong gia đình.Phần lớn phụ nữ ở đây không có việc làm bởi vì ngành nghề chính của vùng là nghề biển, chỉ dành cho người đàn ông sức dài vai rộng, hoặc làm việc trong ngành dịch vụ - du lịch (resort, khách sạn,…) nhưng với họ lại bị hạn chế nhiều kỹ năng cần thiết.

PLANNING AND ACTION_x000D_
Team uniport went into serious research and discovered the Chorkor Oven which was first used in Ghana in the village of Chorkor.The improved chorkor smoker features a “closed banda” design that supports multiple trays for fish smoking and it is a design that integrates well into the traditions and expectations of fish smoking communities, and still introduces simple yet significant improvements, including:_x000D_
	Decreased fuel wood consumption by more than 80% by increasing efficiency._x000D_
	Circulated smoke inside the smoker, so no smoke in eye and less smoke escape to the air._x000D_
	Long-life; up to 15years when made with hydra form bricks._x000D_
	Large capacity. Up to 18Kg of fish per tray; as many 10 tray and above per oven._x000D_
	Higher quality and uniformity of smoked fish due to greater retention of heat and circulation of smoke._x000D_
	Much less time and effort required for operation._x000D_
	Low construction cost._x000D_
We decided to construct a Chorkor oven for the market women that are into fish smoking. This was how we started project smoke it. There was a need for us to maximize our opportunities so we went into partnership with Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND) and with support from the school authority we were able to carry out this project.  It took us five weeks of commitment to complete this project._x000D_
Week 1: Visitation and Publicity_x000D_
UNIPORT team members visited the market women (fish smokers) to create awareness on appropriate technology for fish smoking by introducing the Chorkor Oven and its advantages. We had a meeting with the newly elected market chairman and his executive and told them about the project. We also met with the community chief who gave us the site to build the oven._x000D_
Week 2:  Market Survey_x000D_
Team UNIPORT members met and assigned task to each member to find out the cost of the following materials: Hydraform bricks, transport and offloading, Nails assorted, wood (1 x12 x 14 boards, 3 x 4 x 16, 2 x 3 x 14, 2 x 4 x 16, 1 x 12 x 18), hard board, Breech mesh 16 sq m, batten bundle, sand, transport and offloading, sawmill, and Chorkor oven builder cost._x000D_
Week 3 & 4: Purchase of Materials/Construction _x000D_
The Hydraform bricks were bought and offloaded at the site under the custody of the market women and the market security officer, the roof of the banda house was pulled off by the carpenter and some of the woods were replaced. Four pillar woods were replaced also in order to make the house stand firm.  _x000D_
The carpenter completed the roof that morning and started working on the sides. The chorker oven builder arrived late and could not start work immediately because the truck did not deliver the sand on time. We started constructing the chorkor oven by 1:37pm and by 6:15 we were done. _x000D_
The smoker has two compartments with a total length of 200cm, breath 100cm, and height 57cm.  The opening for insertion and withdrawal of firewood has a width and height of 34.5cm. The internal and external dimension is given below._x000D_

Before the demonstration and training the project was commissioned by Prof. Mrs. Bene Willie-Abbey (DVC Research and Development), also present was Dr. P. C. Nwankanma (Director, Entrepreneurship Centre), the market chairman and his executive and other dignitaries. Immediately after the commissioning there was a practical demonstration with the Chorker Oven to the women fish smokers. Thereafter, they were trained on simple bookkeeping techniques by Mr. Andrew Adu.","The Uniport team designed this project to tackle the factors we identified in our problem analysis and we succeeded in solving these problems using an economic and entrepreneurial approach.Today, in choba, 30 market fish sellers are proud of a better quality of smoked fish, improved working condition, improved marketability of the fish, increased income, reduced health risk associated with inhalation of smoke not to talk of the high quality and uniformity of product due to greater retention time of smoke, reduced smoking time, ease of operation and the importance of keeping financial record in business transactions. All this accounted for the economic approach we employed. The project doesn’t stop there because our target is that by march 2016 the atleast one market in each of the 23 local government areas in Rivers State will have a benefit from this initiative.","While carrying out this project we considered the social, economical and environmental factors:For the social factors, this women use to work as individual, each person minding her business but with the chorkor oven they now work as a team. They also smoke their fish in the unwanted parts of the market basically because of the smoke without considering the health implications, so we taught them the need for a clean environment when preparing edible food for public consumption. We went further in helping them clear the dumpsite and built a banda house where the chokor oven is constructed.

 For the economic factors we discovered the disadvantages with the traditional oven, its inefficiency in capacity and fuel usage, causing poor quality smoked fish and loss resulting from burnt, not to talk of the amount of time used in smoking few fish. We therefore put in place the chokor oven which has proven to use lesser firewood and produce more smoked fish at a time.

2015,107,ET,Ethiopia,ET,Ethiopia,ET,Ethiopia,ET,Ethiopia,, PROJECT TILE: EMPOWERING ETHIOPIAN FEMALE ACADEMIC STAFF IN HIGHER   INSTITUTION (INCREASING FEMALE PHD CANDIDATE),Dilla University,Ethiopia,Ethiopia,0,,['Education'],"Education is one of the main issues that can improve the life of human being and contributing to development in the world. Ethiopia is among one of the east African country with the highest population size. Most of the population in Ethiopia is young about 50% of them women.  Though the size of women in Ethiopia among the population is high or similar to that of male they are not contributing as it is expected. Most of the women left behind because of multiple issues impacted on them. Despite the fact that the government of Ethiopia trying to benefit women still it is not enough to brought them and presenting in front of public as a role model as influential person, this may be due to different visible and invisible factors which could be simple but overlooked to the government. As a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Ethiopia pledged to pursue a series of benchmark and targets relating to gender equality. The targets aim to empower women and eliminate gender disparity in all levels of education by 2015. (1) _x000D_
 Most of the population in Ethiopia resides in rural area. Starting from birth, an Ethiopian female in most families is of lower status and commands little respect relative to her brothers and male counterparts. As soon as she is able, she starts caring for younger siblings, helps in food preparation, and spends long hours hauling firewood and fetching water. As she grows older, she is valued for the role she will play in establishing kinship bonds through marriage to another family, thereby strengthening the community status of her family. She is taught to be subservient, as a disobedient daughter is an embarrassment to her family. Low status characterizes virtually every aspect of girls’ and women’s lives. Given the heavy workload imposed on girls at an early age, early marriage without choice, and a subservient role to both husband and mother-in-law, girls and women are left with few opportunities to make and act on their own decisions.( 2). This all are the challenges of female in Ethiopia. After all those confront some extra ordinary female will attain to the place they want by defending the family and the community negative values and perception in posed on her. Finally with all challenge they may attend higher institution and still the challenges may continue sexual harassment and violence from student, staff. The economic status is also considered among the main challenges of female student. In the university with all the challenges mentioned above she may get a better academic score and have got the chance to join to the university as academic staff after the graduation. The maximum chance she got after she get into the higher institution as academic staff is joining masters program. And after the completion of the master degree she becomes stable. No trust in women’s capacity to achieve the maximum level expected like that of the male._x000D_
The intention of the project will be how could we improve the competence of those female academic staff by putting simple supportive effort and ultimately how could we use the knowledge, the skill of those few women with great potential even with those big challenge they had faced. So that the female academic staff will be benefited from the project and put their effort for great contribution._x000D_
Hence, this project will have input for Ethiopian female academic staff and initiate the government focus toward improving female academic staff education level to higher level hence, they will contribute their part with great scientific knowledge to the local community plus to the world. Therefore the project impact will not only for individual benefit but it’s the concern for global community._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
1.1	Statement of the Problem_x000D_
_x000D_
Eliminating gender disparity is extremely challenging for Ethiopia because of the low base from which it begins. Ethiopian ministry of education must monitor and encourage good practice that will lead to gender equality and understanding of gender issues in higher education, and must also achieve equality within its own workforce._x000D_
 _x000D_
The Education and Training Policy has been the major framework for reform and transformation. The policy has stressed issues of quality and relevance in educational programs; quality of teaching staff and facilities; improvement of learning process towards a focus on students; improvement of management and leadership.(3) _x000D_
_x000D_
The construction of Universities is increasing in Ethiopia so that there will be higher chance for women to join and have the access for higher Education since the begging of affirmative action. Though the issue of the undergraduate female student is considered a little bit, there is huge gap toward improving the academic rank of the female staff in the higher institution of Ethiopian university. Higher education female staff becomes stable after they have got their masters degree. Women have multiple reasons for this specific case there are multiple burdens on her. She will thought about social issue like marriage, nature,(pregnancy,birth,child caring) no network for any updated information then she becomes stable._x000D_
 _x000D_
According to the NICHE project reports by Dr.Anouka van Eerdewijk and Franz Wong assessment of female faculty and leadership, among PhD holder academic staff on duty male 93% and female 7% and PhD holder academic staff on leave accounts male 94% and 6% female in 2014 in Ethiopia higher institution respectively. 5% of the leadership positions are occupied by women. All presidents and VPs are male. Gender balance in leadership positions is not higher at levels of colleges or departments. About 7% of decision making place (Senate member) were occupied by women and 11% of the members of Academic Commissions are women.( 4,5) Yet, for all degrees, the share of female faculty is far below the target of 20% for 2014/2015._x000D_
_x000D_
In leadership position as it is observed the percentage is really incredible. Could we say that we are living, computing with the world imagine the entire figure why our contribution is less. Is that because female has no knowledge and skills to do things? Even Ethiopian Ministry of Education has no clear strategy to encourage the female academic staff in higher institution. Even though the figure of female academic staff is very small they were not supported yet to get them to higher level education which is PhD they became sable after they do their masters degree. This may be due to different factors. Female academic staff has different role-stressors level than male academic staff. Women in Ethiopia had faced a lot of challenge. The intention to leave the university is higher among the female academic staff than in the male staff.(6)_x000D_
_x000D_
Ethiopian women wishing to follow a university education must overcome significant social and educational disadvantages. Women in Ethiopia face lots of challenges starting from lower grade to the higher education not only that their challenges will go to the future which is un-endless. They come from different cultures where they have grown in the environment which was said you can’t, no-body is appreciating the women for her multiple duties in the home. Women from rural areas in particularly do not have the confidence to assert or defend themselves. In addition their schooling can be interrupted or curtailed for a variety of reasons including: families not seeing the education of women as important; schools being long distances from home; schools without toilet facilities; and girls working in the home. Despite of the problems that the women face few of them may reach better place by defeating the challenges but still we need to consider her effort with simple support we can build their capacity. When we see one of the Ethiopian higher institution strategies which is increasing the participation of women in research activities but sill the strategy lucks what activities to do in order to encourage and increase their participation.

Random interviews with women and youth helped in analysing the local situation related to gender based violence and identify the nature of risks women and youth face in the community. The following facts emerged which shows the alarming situation of gender violence and gender discrimination in slums and marginalized communities:_x000D_
Many core issues related to the safety of adolescent youth girls and women especially those in low income is neglected. Inadequate services affected women and girls the most as they spend a considerable amount of time and energy accessing essential services such as water and sanitation. The infrastructure and design of such services in the said areas often do not respond to the needs of the women and girls. Lack of proper maintenance of the community toilet complexes, limited access at certain times of the day, inadequate supply of water and lack of facilities for disposal of menstrual waste illustrated the gender gap in services.  More than two third of girls reported ‘unsafe and insecure living environment’ as one of the disadvantages of living in the city. Unsafe environment and difficult commuting is one of the reasons that many girls also drop out of school after Grade 6 with the key reason being that going to high school requires a lot of travel which is not allowed to girls for reasons of safety.  The number of dropout among girls (52%) is significantly higher than the dropout rates among boys (40%)._x000D_
As a responsible and responsive civil society actor, Anchal recognizes the need to revisit the  target area  where girls have raised issues on safety and initiate a series of activities that involve city planners, the law enforcement agencies, and policy makers to come together with young girls and boys,  civil society and women’s groups to make the city  and communication spaces more inclusive and responsive to the needs of our adolescent and young girls so that they may participate safely in the exciting and dynamic developments that are taking place in these arenas. _x000D_
The project will be implemented in slum settings of North and North East Delhi initially and can be replicated to other areas of Delhi further. Following are the important objectives under proposed action of this program:_x000D_
1.	Women and girls enjoy increased participation outside their homes and in the community where they can actively contribute in the distribution and decision making within the community. Women and young people are empowered and adopt leadership roles to contribute to the economic life of their family and community._x000D_
2.	The community is aware of the challenges and barriers to safe access to resources for youth girls and women and pro-actively addresses them. _x000D_

This would result in jobs for women in rural areas._x000D_
The project presents the intervention of providing small Tunnel Dryers on an area of 100-150 sft for processing of Apricots, Cherries, Grapes and Mulberry by individual Women in Astore district of Gilgit-Baltistan (Himalaya) region in Pakistan. Astore is in harsh climatic Himalayan region with steep mountains and limited agricultural land. According to 2009 statistics the apricot production in Astore district was 2932 tons, Cherry 128 tons, Grapes 182 tons and Mulberry 694 tons. Out of this production the %age of dry fruits marketed is 15% apricots and 0% of others. Losses account for 67% of Apricots, 19% cherries, 11% grapes and 64% mulberry. _x000D_
Prime reasons of under development are;_x000D_
•	Lack of resources / capital for and understanding about construction of plastic and electric processing unit and its management._x000D_
•	Limited access to fruit processing technology, processing techniques and lack of knowledge about drying fruits in efficient and effective manner.  _x000D_
•	Processing and market linkages at this level are very weak, which is the main cause of slow flow of products towards market and wastage of fruits._x000D_
This resulted in very low income for families and especially very weak position of women in Astore. Poverty prevails in the district which affects women more than men. Malnutrition and associated diseases are common among women in Astore._x000D_
_x000D_
Keeping in view the abundant input supplies and production of apricots, cherries, grapes and mulberry the establishment of Solar Tunnel Dryers are vital for women farmers of Astore. These tunnels will be a source of processing and drying of fruits and vegetables under hygienic conditions ensuring organic quality of the dried products.  In addition to this re-drying method for better color and quality, packaging according to health and hygiene standards,  packaging  and other promotional activities. The value added products automatically strengthen the market linkages would be source of self-employment opportunities, income generation and job creation to the local people especially the women at all level. The salient features of proposed intervention are:_x000D_
_x000D_
1.	Provision of solar tunnel dryers to 20 women of Astore district._x000D_
2.	Methodology of grant will be on cost sharing basis i.e. structure and components of solar tunnel dryer will be provided by the project while transportation, installation, labor and other costs such as civil works, etc. will be borne by the grantee._x000D_
3.	Capacity building through field level training on operation and management of solar tunnel dryer for 20 grantee women by the project. Two days training in district Astore. 2 sessions will be held. Each session will train 10 women._x000D_
4.	Training of 20 women on packaging and marketing in Astore. One session of two days for 20 women. Field demonstration will be part of training._x000D_

6.  Conducted 1 survey at the end of project for assessment of achievements.","The main problem to be solved is improving the economic status of women in Astore district. For centuries, women from Astore have been deprived of these rights. Economic opportunities are extremely low for women although vast quantity and quality of fruits are present in the area that need to be properly utilized for the economic benefit especially of women. Low economic status leads to health suffering of women due to unhygienic living, drinking of filthy water, no swage system and malnourishment. Women in Astore are the major victims of health related issues. Presently malnutrition, about 70-80% anemia, psychological problems, etc. are main health issues of women of Astore. Women in other districts of province enjoy better living status, e.g. in Gilgit, Hunza, Ghizer, etc. women have established their businesses based on agriculture and horticultural produce.

So far; I have impacted about 250 women already, having alone; visited the townships of Alexandra, Coronationville and Diepsloot (once each), providing them with legal information and basic services enabling them to best start and/or finalise pending legal cases mostly against the men in their lives.

My Medical is an online portal that provides online medical facilities to large number of people in Bangladesh via mobile, laptop or smart devices. The patient may belong to any part of the country. Our online portal contains the record of all the patient. _x000D_
_x000D_
The registered clients will get other medical services like client's history, nearest blood donor (currently people have difficulty finding blood donors information), nearest medical center, nearest diagnostic center with 20% discount, doctor's schedule & address, online doctor’s appointment system, nearest ambulance information, online drug store, announcement of medical campaign etc. within immediately at very low cost. The patient also can get the facilities for visiting the doctor physically if needed. In Bangladesh most of the parents are not aware of the vaccination that should be given to their children; our system will give notification to all the registered clients regarding the appropriate date of the vaccine. _x000D_
_x000D_
Currently, only a few vaccines are maintained by government. Most of the vaccines can be obtained on payment. Others are announced by the government but not maintained in the database. Therefore, most of the times, people miss it or get overdosed. This way the government or sponsor does not get the clear idea of the distributed vaccination._x000D_
_x000D_
Explanation of problem and context:_x000D_
The approximate population in Bangladesh is 160 Million. At present, approximately 70% people do not know about primary medical treatment due to insufficient knowledge or long distance from nearest hospital. Due to such problems most of the patient position pass away and do not get proper treatment. According to World Bank (Refer to WB site: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS) only 0.3 physicians per 1000 people is serving which is very low compared to the benchmark._x000D_
At present, some mobile operators in Bangladesh give limited medical advice through mobile. however, there are some problems related to the service. These are listed below: 1.Database is not being maintained. Therefore, whenever a user calls for medical facility he/she has to tell his vitals every time._x000D_
2.No written prescription is given to the customer. _x000D_
3.There is no facility of video conferencing with the doctor. _x000D_
4.It costs more than actual charges to the users as it is via mobile phone. _x000D_
5.The person attending the call will not give information about themselves e.g. their personal name, proper medical institution details, name of their local registered medical association number etc._x000D_
_x000D_
Doctor's visit is expensive for many people as the average income of a common man does not exceed USD 150 per month. the minimum cost for the initial check-up cost every time from USD 6 - 12. this is hardly affordable by an average man._x000D_
_x000D_
Explanation of Solution: Why is it relevant? _x000D_
In Bangladesh, currently there is lack of ICT use in medical sector. Mostly doctors prefer to work in city as most of the facilities are available there. None of them wants to work in rural areas. Due to this, people of rural areas do not get enough medical facilities. Also, hospitals are far from rural areas, which makes it difficult for rural people to go for treatment. for critical patients, no ambulances are available at a call's distance which increase the death rate._x000D_
_x000D_
What is new about it?_x000D_
Step start to follow the new invention of Internet of Things (IoT). We can easily check the pulse rate, temperature etc. using the latest smart phone. Any time, within 24 hours customer can get the essential medical service. Customer will get the service from anywhere in the Bangladesh (within the mobile network). Customer will get the proper information in the right time. If it needs more time to reach the hospital, customer will get the direction from our respective doctor. Some time doctor can advice through video conference and the customer can participate through mobile, tablet, laptop etc. So customer can try to easily use the primary necessary treatment._x000D_
_x000D_
Once a customer completes the registration he/she will get service for a year which is very cheap for them in case of doctor’s help in the present situation of Bangladesh. _x000D_
_x000D_
The portal maintain the database of the all users. Current treatment details, history or test reports can be uploaded in patient file by himself. Users can retrieve their prescriptions through mobiles, tabs etc. Using internet and print it if necessary or from pharmacy he will easily buy medicine or he/she can show the history to another doctor easily._x000D_
","Target Customer/market (market size and potential market share)Primary Target Market: Chittagong Division, Bangladesh, Gradually Whole Country._x000D_

To work collaboratively with the regional coordinating council, regional and district health directorates to promote the health of pregnant women._x000D_
To monitor and evaluate as well as keep data on pregnant women. _x000D_
","Pregnant women in rural Ghana have challenges knowing early pregnancy complications due to their inability to have access to basic ultrasound imaging and this results in preventable maternal and child deaths.

The technology is mostly found in the district hospitals which put pressure on the facility because all pregnant women in the area have to come to the hospital on selected days to queue for the service.



Some pregnant women have to sleep over to the next day exposing themselves to diseases and infections like malaria.



The project will seek to provide free ultrasound for these women in their own community to prevent maternal and child mortality. TT"

Funding for education is scarce and girls are traditionally relied upon for undertaking the painstaking task of supporting their mothers to source for means of livelihoods, resulting in under-enrolment of girls and other children from similar low income families in school.

Country guides provide all the relevant information to start and grow an enterprise in a given country, from the legal and financial aspects (how and where to register the business, which taxes are compulsory, etc.) to an overview of entrepreneurship hubs and networks, as well as funding opportunities (from government grants to business angels and crowdfunding platforms). This will considerably facilitate the process of starting and growing a business for young women entrepreneurs, in countries where too often the long and bureaucratic process of incorporating a startup deters young people from following up on their innovative ideas._x000D_

Ye! recognizes that unemployment and poverty disproportionately impact young women and girls from developing countries. In many countries across Africa, the Middle East and Asia, young women are very disadvantaged when trying to start their own business, due to a combination of economic and social challenges, in addition to the obstacles facing all young entrepreneurs (lack of resources, access to funding, etc).

2015,56,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,PK,Pakistan,,Establishment of women resource center for women empowerment.,Sahara Community Support Programme (SCSP),Pakistan,Pakistan,0,,"['Education', 'Health', 'Entrepreneurship & Business']","Background/JustificationWomen/girls are generally ignored in most of developing countries. In Pakistan only a short percentage of women are involved in politics, business & jobs mostly in developed cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan & Faisalabad. Majority of women in small cities don’t have opportunity of equality in jobs, salaries, politics & business. Mansehra is one of the developing city of Pakistan where women are mostly discouraged to involve in business & politics due to cultural constraints. Literate women/girls move for jobs but there is no concept of private business for women in District Mansehra. Literate women/girls get income by jobs but illiterate women/girls remain dependent of male (father, brother, husband). Some times in their lives due to this dependency they face huge troubles of fulfilling their basic needs. They depends on others even for buying food, clothes, vegetable, transportation, health cure & education. Women living in Mansehra don’t have any idea about kitchen budget management & home budget management which causes extra expenditure & they face problem to get their basic needs.. In such situations they suffer too much by missing basic needs of lives. To over come the problem there is intense need to involve those women/girls in small business. If they come to practical field they can generate income by themselves & fulfill their basic needs. _x000D_
Proposed Solution_x000D_
Keeping in view the critical situation of women living in Mansehra we can establish a training resource/display center in Mansehra. To create opportunity for women/girls of Mansehra in income generation & business development this resource center will play important role. In this resource/display center women from whole city & surrounding areas will come for getting trainings of embroidery, sewing, cutting, candle making, making baby products, honey bee farming & kitchen gardening. As this resource/display center will also be used to sell/display products prepared in training center during & after completing trainings of women/girls, they will also get practical training of selling products, customer handling & marketing products. Beside this they will be trained about home/kitchen budget management which will affect their home budgets. By this training they will plan home budgets & prioritize their basic needs & extra expense will be controlled. In this way they will be able to get theoretical as well as practical training of preparing products & selling them to customers. Beside this the display center will produce enough income to meet the expenses of training center as well as display center including, salaries, fare, utilities, raw material & transportation etc. In this resource center job opportunities will also create for sale girls, counter girls & administration. They will also get jobs in this center & be able to get enough money for their own expenses. After a reasonable time period they will be able to start their own display/training centers in different locations of the District which will cause sustainable women empowerment._x000D_

The population of Kakuma refugee camp currently stands at 170,000. Majority (>99%) of the refugee population is from South Sudan, Somalia, Sudan, DRC, Ethiopia, Burundi and Uganda.  Refugees are entirely dependent on humanitarian food aid, less than 1/3 of children and youth attend school and only 2/3 have adequate shelter.  Once registered with UNHCR, officially refugees cannot leave the camp and human rights conditions are fragile, with minimal reporting of cases of child and women violent assault/rape and domestic abuse. Adolescents (13 to 19 years) make 25% of the Kakuma Refugee Camp population.During war or crisis, the disruption of families and communities, and the loss of educational opportunities, jobs and other meaningful activities are common challenges that adolescents face. Many adolescents in the camp have lost access to family, social supports and health services as a result of displacement. Girls are especially vulnerable to sexual violence, which further increases the risks of unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortions and STIs including HIV. Adolescents face increased risks to their sexual and reproductive health and education. Therefore, provision of appropriate sexual and reproductive health as well as livelihood services is essential. _x000D_

SAVIC believes  that the key to a brighter future is to incorporate adolescents’ talents and potential for economic improvements of their communities._x000D_

We believe access to reproductive is crucial to build a healthier and economically empowered youth. SAVIC will support young people to make informed choices about their reproductive health and skills development. ","1.

At least 120 sexually active girls freely access reproductive health counseling and services at the camp facilities._x000D_
3.	Increased self-reliance for 60 girls and their family members through livelihood training, facilitation, and support._x000D_
4.	Increased percentage of relevant community members (parents, clinic staff etc.) who have a positive attitude about the use of family planning in sexually active young people._x000D_
","A recent survey (July 2014) followed by focus group discussions has shown that at least 50% of young people (12-19) are engaging in sexual relationships. Most of these young people are compelled to engage in such relationships for a survival. Because of the different traditional norms, girls cannot access reproductive health services to avoid pregnancy or HIV. Many girls get unintended pregnancies, resulting in a large number of girls dropping out of schools, suffer health complications, and incur a financial burden on themselves and their new families.Goal

The project aims to reduce unintended pregnancies, HIV infections and promote sustainable economic independence among adolescent and young people in Kakuma. --"

After 1994 Rwanda Genocide against Tutsi, many of them   lost their parents and extended families; they had to assume a parental role for their younger brothers and sisters while they were still children themselves. The Government of Rwanda and Non-Government Organization tried extensively its best in replenishing these people’s properties, to find a solution to the country’s Child headed households-one of the many consequences of the Genocide. _x000D_
Some of them were given houses, which they now call home. However, these people are still poor due to inadequate resources. For about 20 years, almost everyone in this area has been affected by Genocide; therefore poverty has prevailed in this area.They have been living in their homes without incomes to purchase food or water sanitation equipment. Often, they have to wait for donations, leaving many to suffer and many orphans have deserted their schooling to fulfil their other responsibilities and many resulted into unwanted pregnancies. _x000D_
The children dropped out schools, others become street children, others are violated, and others are separated with their parents, became drug abusers and are now in conflict with the law committing such crimes like lobbers, violent and late if actions are not undertaken will become terrorist and murders  _x000D_
This therefore raises a need to motivate the parents of these children to work together for a brighter future to their Children who are vulnerable because there is lack of enough care takers. In addition, the community lacks local initiatives to promote ECD in the community due to limited capacity, ignorance and lack of similar service in the community.  To end the above mentioned challenges Peace & Hope Initiative undertook a long life project with aim to promote Early Childhood Development.

This  device will have an outer shape like that of a tablet, or like an Ipad, but that has some kind of robotic in build programs that could recognize voice and give laudable responses and judgment to questions immediately when asked, or either stating the correctness or faultiness in statements made or answers given to certain questions asked by the tablet to a learner, as a human being would normally do. It would be like a small hand tablet, that looks attractive to children in Pre-school, kindergartens and primary schools, as well as it would be designed with different age groups, sizes, and shapes, respecting the different levels and ages of the educational cycle. This device would be able to have inserted pre recorded study materials for children on its internal hard disc build as a mobile study application, using  Android 4.4 technology, IOS, Java,CSC or some other Technology that can easily accept the touch screen coding commands. The study Data would be coded on different subject matters as taught in pre-schools, kindergartens and primary schools. The tablet would also have recorded materials on external disc of different subjects, which would accompany the device, when purchased, such that if a kid holds it on the hand and immediately ask a question or want to study a particular subject or topic from a particular subject line, this device can easily bring out a laudable response or lessons, programed under that subject as a teacher would have normally done in a class room in response to a child’s question, and on the same time producing scribed out responses on the surface of the tablet for the child to see and understand. This will help the children and student to learn by seeing and hearing, as well as participating with the device as if it were a teacher. This device will also help children to receive possible answers to questions even in the absence of their teachers or guardians at home._x000D_

HOW DOES THIS DEVICE FUNCTIONS?_x000D_
We have developed a child learning approach that will attract the child to personally touch and discover information and lessons that have been programed in the study application. The attractive approach is one that makes use of blinking and highlighting menu items consisting of bright colours that draws the attention of a child to touch the blinking and highlighted buttons or menu items, which if touched, zooms out another menu and presents a lesson coded under that menu to the child, and like wise also helps the child to repeat the pronunciation of certain letters and words presented to him or her, as well as learn to  pronounce and read sentences while also trying to write certain letters on the surface of the tablet and also drawing and coloring certain objects. _x000D_
 The device shall also be solar energize, manufactured to avoid issues concerning electricity shortage or problems of energy shortages in developing countries today,  most of these developing countries suffer from under education and also from energy crises, so to let it be effective, pupils and students most not worry about where to have electricity to charge the devices, they should be able to have their devices charged by the time they expose it to sun light._x000D_

There are few opportunities to enter into wage employment; most of Cameroon's girls earn income on a day-to-day basis by trading and carrying things on their heads on local markets or as day laborers in very difficult conditions and there is also the high marginalization of girls. The situation of young women is particularly challenging. Young girls in our communities are not in school and very few of them can read and write good English, this is because our people don’t believe in the young women that they can also play a huge part in the society.

Many girls have dropped out of school due to teenage pregnancy or lack of school fees and have become useless in the community. Therefore, this program will empower the targeted women with acquired skills that will help them to do their own business and be self sustaining hence geared at reducing unemployment. A-"

Many of the laborers take land for lease and do agriculture, but the returns are not profitable as they have to depend on middlemen for loan at 30% interest rate or Micro Finance Institutions for loan with 25 to 30% as interest rates. After cultivation, their income will be sufficient in repaying the capital along with interest to middlemen and micro finance institutions. If there is any loss due to natural calamities, the poor farmer has to sell assets in repayment of the loan.

Similarly, the problems of rural artisans capital support with huge interest rates on one side and lack of marketing linkages on the other side has resulted in occupational shift. The rural artisans are not able to have the returns in repayment of loan. As part of credit appraisal, these rural artisans and marginal farmers are excluded from formal credit systems due to lack of asset base (land documents, Logbooks etc) II"

SASANE has an office located in its volunteer guesthouse, Pokhara. It is centrally located for easy access to many cultural and fascinating “must-see” sights around Pokhara, such as:_x000D_

3. World Peace Pagoda_x000D_

5.  Gupteswar Gupha (Cave)_x000D_
SASANE has been working in collaboration with Planeterra Foundation and G Adventures, a small-group adventure travel experts (website: www.gadventures.com) in Kathmandu. Survivors would take G Adventures travelers on half-day tours either in the morning or afternoon for approximately 3½ hours, which would include walking and cab rides to the “must-see” sights listed above. _x000D_
Before or after each half-day tour (as an included or optional activity, depending on the itinerary), the G Adventures travelers would visit SASANE’s guesthouse for a delicious home cooked pre-set lunch of authentic, traditional Nepali food (including vegetarian and meat dishes). The survivors would interact with the travelers by sharing recipes and by demonstrating how one of the most famous dishes in Nepal, mo mos (traditional Nepali dumplings), is made. Travelers can take turns trying to make mo mos, which for a seemingly simple dish, are quite difficult to make! _x000D_
The first priority would be organizing English language classes for the survivors. The English language classes would be run by a TOEFL certified teacher. There are already a few survivors whose English skills are very good. Then, the survivors with the best English language skills (as determined by their English teacher) could apply to be part of the tour guide and hospitality training program. _x000D_
The G Adventures CEOs (who already lead tours through Pokhara) assist in the tour guide training by conducting the half-day tours, while the survivors “shadow” the CEOs. This would allow the survivors to learn critical “on the job” skills (i.e. keeping travelers to a set schedule, organizing tickets to the sights, answering travelers questions, etc.) As these CEOs likely know Hindi and potentially Nepali as well, they can assist with any language barrier issues that may arise with travelers while the survivors are “in-training”. _x000D_
Over time, the survivors with the most tour guiding and hospitality experience will train new survivors so the tour guide and hospitality training program can become sustainable._x000D_

(3)	upgrade the kitchen facilities in SASANE’s guesthouse;_x000D_
(4)    transportation for the survivor girls._x000D_
(5)    monitoring and evaluation_x000D_
","The first priority would be organizing English language classes for the survivors. The English language classes will be provided for six months which would be run by a TOEFL certified teacher. Then, the survivors with the best English language skills (as determined by their English teacher) could apply to be part of the tour guide and hospitality training program, which would initially be run by a person or persons recommended by G Adventures.The tour guide and hospitality training will be of three months.

","Each year, an estimated 30,000 Nepali girls are tricked, coerced, abducted or willingly sold by their families into sexual slavery or forced labour. These girls have little to no education or employment opportunities and are often between 14-25 years old or younger. These young girls are forced to work as prostitutes in brothels or forced labour until they are too sick to work. Months or years later, some of these women are rescued, escape or somehow manage to survive. They are Nepal’s survivors. My idea is to leverage and support SASANE’s innovative, grassroots effort to empower human trafficking survivors by training them to become tour guides and hospitality staff, so they can have access to the resources and gain the economic benefits of the rapidly growing tourist industry in Nepal.  This idea will reach out to these vulnerable women, who are at risk of re-trafficking.

With recent research highlighting the impact of gender inequalities on development, there has been a compelling move toward investing in programs that increase women’s economic participation with policies and interventions aimed at promoting women’s economic empowerment. The economic empowerment of women has been linked to: poverty reduction especially in low-income households facilitates the achievement of other important public policy goals such as economic growth, improved human development, and reduced violence.  In recent times it has become widely accepted that gender equality and women’s empowerment are key cornerstones in achieving development results._x000D_
Background (literature review)_x000D_
The concept of empowering women through measures to increase social, economic and political participation has gained momentum over the past three decades.  The promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women is recognized as a key step in addressing extreme poverty as noted in the Millenium Development Goals (MDG’s).  It is noted that the economic participation of women is important not only to lower the levels of poverty among women, but is also a crucial step in encouraging economic development in countries as a whole.  There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that education, employment and ownership rights of women have a powerful influence on their ability to control their environment and contribute to economic development.  The World Bank describes gender equality as smart economics, noting that the integration of women in well functioning markets as both consumers and producers is linked to economic development, growth and greater welfare. (World Development Report 2012)_x000D_
Women’s economic empowerment is defined as the capacity for women to participate in, contribute to and benefit from growth processes in ways that recognize the value of their contribution, respect their dignity and make it possible to negotiate a fairer distribution of the benefits of growth (Eyben et al., 2008).  Tornqvist and Schmitz define it as the process which increases women’s real power over economic decisions that influence their lives and priorities in society.  It can be achieved through equal access to and control over critical economic resources and opportunities and the elimination of structural gender inequalities in the labour market including a better sharing of unpaid care work (Tornqvist and Schmitz 2009 p.9).  The economic empowerment of women is central to the achievement of gender equality and the implementation of international commitments (OECD, 2012).  UN Women considers that women’s economic empowerment is essential for any strategy of poverty alleviation and defines this as ‘having access to and control over the means to make a living on a sustainable and long term basis, and receiving the material benefits of this access and control’ (Carr, 2000; Mosedale, 2005)_x000D_
A world bank report noted that the unequal education and employment opportunities for women in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) is estimated to have retarded annual per capita growth by 0.8 percentage points between 1960 and 1992, this is crucial because a boost of 0.8 percentage points per year would have doubled economic growth, the study further suggests that gender inequality appears to account for about 15-20% of the growth performance between SSA and East Asia.  Gender equality may not be the main cause of poverty in Africa but it is a key element in accounting for the regions poor economic performance.  An OECD report (2012) highlights that when more women work, economies grow; an increase in female labour force participation results in faster economic growth.  Blackden et al also note that much of the economic activity in Africa is in the hands of women especially in Agriculture and informal business, creating opportunities for women can help to not only empower them but also to unlock the full economic potential for their nations._x000D_
Canagarajah et al highlight the fact that when provided with the opportunity women are able to participate and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction citing the example of Uganda between 1992 and 1996 where women’s participation in the rural non farm sector increased as such raising the income of women and of households headed by them (Gender and economic growth in Uganda p.30)_x000D_
John Ward et al in their research find critical evidence that greater gender equality in the developing world could enhance economic growth, the evidence links improving gender equality to key factors of economic growth by expanding the stock of human capital, raising labour productivity, improving agricultural productivity and increasing stock of physical capital._x000D_
Netsaye underscores the fact that despite the great strides achieved in empowering women, gender inequality continues to be a major challenge in Africa.  It is prevalent in all sectors of the economy including the labour market.  This is despite the fact that women contribute immensely to the labour market, training and education. (Gender and economic empowerment in Africa: evidence and policy p.88).  She highlights the various initiatives undertaken at the regional level with the aim of achieving women’s empowerment such as:  the African Union protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa adopted in 2005 to protect women’s economic and social rights, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) which proposes to reduce gender disparities on the African continent and the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo which also called for women’s empowerment; this coupled with the various legislations and policies adopted at the country level still the issue of gender equality and empowerment is yet to be fully integrated into policy formulation with gender gaps still existing between men and women in economic opportunities(p.89)_x000D_
Hobson notes that women dominate the informal sector that plays a huge role in SSA economies (Hobson 2011).  The informal sector employs 72% of the non agricultural employment in SSA and 48% in North Africa (Dejene, 2007). In Kenya during the last decade, the growth rate in the sector’s employment has remained above that of the formal sector, which declined over the same period. The informal sector has seen its share in total employment rise from 16% in 1980, to 63.6% in 1997 and 70% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2001, employment in the sector rose by 11.4%. Its share in GDP has also recorded increases, rising from 13% in 1993 to 18% in 1999 (Republic of Kenya, 2002). Sectorally, the informal sector is the second largest source of employment after small-scale agriculture  According to the ILO in SSA 84% of women are informally employed compared to 63% of men; women in Africa are predominantly work in agricultural sector involved in subsistence farming.  FAO estimates that 60% of employed women in SSA women work in agriculture and play a big role in food security in the region.  In Kenya 75% of women live in the rural area and are involved in floriculture, growing of tea and coffee, vegetables and cereals (ILO, 2004).  It is however noted that there are still gender gaps that exist hindering women’s economic participation.  These gaps inflict costs on the society in terms of lost agricultural output, food security and economic growth.  Women in this sector face numerous challenges, with evidence showing that constraints to land ownership, lack of access to inputs by women are key impediments to increasing agricultural output and economic growth.  _x000D_
A striking phenomenon of recent times is the extent to which women’s participation in the labour force has increased. This increased participation has been driving employment trends and the gender gaps in labour force participation rates have been shrinking.  A majority of women in SSA are engaged in Micro and Small enterprises (MSE’s), in Kenya 49% of women nationally are engaged in MSE’s nationally, in the rural areas they account for 55.8% of women working in MSE’s.  Women are often engaged in work that is considered female such as food processing, dressmaking and tailoring.  Their involvement in the informal business sector is a vital contribution to poverty reduction, wealth creation and employment (UN Women, 2011).  However mainstream government economic policies and trade agreements often neglect these women.  Women in this sector often find it difficult to access credit due to lack collateral; a factor that limits the scale of their operations.  In Kenya the USAID obligated US$12.9 million as a guarantee to stimulate lending in the SME sectors by providing additional collateral risk mitigation for SME’s that are owned and managed by women (OECD, 2012)._x000D_

In Tanzania, women are disproportionately concentrated in vulnerable forms of work and face occupational segregation and low wages relative to men. Economic constraints include: lack of full-time employment; lack of access to care for children and dependents; the pressures of global competition that keep female wages down; and direct discrimination. Growing numbers of youth, particularly girls who are entering Tanzania’s labor force are also at risk. In Tanzania, youth unemployment increased from 5.3 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2011.

Training will include general training on the effects of climate change on their livelihoods, productivity and physical well-being as well as the impact agriculture has on the environment as well as training on Eco-friendly afro-forestry practices and optimal use of environmental resources. There will also be live demonstration of indigenous technology to adapt to climate change and break out session showing the women how to use such technology and showing interested women how to build such technology.

The grant will be used to organize and train the people concerned. _x000D_
The concept of Social Business_x000D_
This concept of social business is developed by Rathindranath Pal_x000D_
_x000D_
The context_x000D_
I have a dream. It is for the ordinary people. It is to take the social progress to a new height. I dream that the world will be a lovely and fair place someday. And the people would enjoy it with full vigor and economic security._x000D_
To make the world a fair place, and achieve the economic security for the ordinary people I have always searched for a right socio-economic order and now I’ve developed a new kind of business model that can ensure parity among the people in the society, and therefore, nations which didn’t attain prosperity yet, can get the opportunity to build them up using this model. _x000D_
Why I am thinking of a model to do business in a new way? And why I am calling it Social Business?_x000D_
I am thinking of a new way to do business to give the world economic order a new shape. The present one is mostly dominated by a few business groups of the world. Actually they are captivating the world to make policy in favor of them. The roots of the conflict among the people of the society and the countries at large lie here. _x000D_
This scenario is common in the poor and developing countries. You can see few dishonest people are grabbing public resources in the name of business, becoming elected members in the parliament and making policy to save them. They even swallow the last savings of the public that they deposit in the banks and invest in the capital market to reap small benefit. These people are not interested to pay taxes too. So the businesses they do are not supportive to the further development of the society._x000D_
_x000D_
On the contrary, you know, global wealth inequality is very hopeless. I want to put a ‘very’ before hopeless.  Imagine, the top 1% people own 41% wealth of the world.  Top 10% own 86% of the wealth. And bottom half just own 1% of the wealth of the world! So billions of people are living a very hard life where as the number of billionaires (who own more than $1 billion or more) are increasing every year. The number of billionaires has reached at 2325 in 2014 after 7% increase in the last year. This is happening due to present system of business. The present concepts of business groups give ownership to their inner circle - to a few people._x000D_
Inequality was not so severe in the nineteenth century as that time industrial revolution was just taking place. In spite of that Karl Mark wanted to change the economic order of the world. He gave his judgment in favor to the labors than capital. Lenin made a way to make it happened the idea as Leninism. As a result, we found a new type of state owned business – a new economic order. _x000D_
This socialist model of business has collapsed with the fall of Soviet Union. Virtually, the socialism is dead now. There are two major reasons behind the fall of socialism. First, it produced a lethargic administration controlled by the central government. Second, the system could not accommodate the human creativity and freedom of choice. Beyond that limitation, it had great impact on the capitalist system._x000D_
_x000D_
Again, redistribution of resources to many has been urgent but that will not happen in a way like socialism. So, the emergence of a new kind of business is urgent, where ordinary people can participate with their small capital, even who don’t have any, can be involved in business and can get profit of the business to live a meaningful and enjoyable life. Thus many people of the society will have access to the meaningful economic activities._x000D_
This type of business will be joint enterprises by the ordinary people. It will have commitment to be honest and to sincere to their society. It will be transparent and tax payers. It will create social funds for the society and the government that needs in time. It will act as social platform, on which people of the society will have right to access to get their personal benefit, and to monitor and guide it. So, it is better to call this type of business as social business, because ordinary social people are doing business for the benefit of themselves and for the society as well. Thus, it will create one type of social ownership, contribute to increase the social capital, and finally serve the democratic environment._x000D_
_x000D_
Definition: A social business is a joint venture by a maximum number of people who are agreed to share the maximum profit among its associate partners and for social causes with the aim to do honest business and redistribution of resources to many so that poverty gap can be reduced, understanding among the people of the society (social capital) can be increased, government can get maximum taxes to build up the country and ultimately the world can be a fair place. (In short)_x000D_
_x000D_
Clarification of the idea_x000D_
_x000D_
A social business is a joint venture_x000D_
A social business will be a joint entrepreneurship of a group of common people. The number of participants will depend on the volume and nature of business and the number will increase simultaneously with the expansion of the business. This is to achieve the ultimate objective of a social business – the redistribution of resource to many – so that capital cannot be concentrate to a few people. _x000D_
_x000D_
Inclusion of associate partner_x000D_
Inclusion of associate partner is an important feature of social business. It is for the people who do not have money but can contribute their labour or expertise and become owner of a business. Types and number of associate partner will vary based on the nature and volume of the business._x000D_
_x000D_
A social business is a profitable entity_x000D_
In my view, all the business should be profitable entities unless it is charity business. I have proposed to pay major share of profit (min. 50%) to its associate partners and the wellbeing of society._x000D_
_x000D_
A social business is an honest business and tax payer_x000D_
A social business must be socially transparent. Therefore, all the information it must be kept open to the public through web portal regularly. Transparency is more than a word. It will be the way of doing social business. A social business have to create such an option so that anybody (may be a citizen group, organization, law enforcement authority, etc.) can monitor it if needed or they wish to see whether it is involved any criminal activities or that is harmful for the society. This policy is adapted, because social business must hate the creation of black money. On the contrary, it is believed in the model that an honest Tax Paying society is essential to build up a developed nation. It must not hide the profit or cannot show any unforeseen expenditure to reduce the taxes. _x000D_
_x000D_
No access to capital market_x000D_
A social business cannot be enlisted in capital market never at no time. One of the objectives of the social business is to eliminate the capital market from the world; because it gives birth of a bubble economy. It swallows the money of the ordinary people most of the time. So we have to find out a new type of capital market (if needed). We have to stop to sale a $10 bond/share of a company, which can pay $2-3 profit a year (say) cannot be sold at $100 or more._x000D_
_x000D_
Creation of social fund_x000D_
A social business will create different types of social fund that can contribute to the society and the government enormously. As for example, it is seen that during natural calamities government invites rich people to donate money. This is not a noble practice. Rather, the social business groups believe that the society/government would have the right to use these social funds in times as a social business (other business too) does business and makes profit from the society._x000D_
_x000D_
A social business is a social platform_x000D_
A social business is a Social Platform because it always thinks to do the betterment of the society and its people within its capacity. Anybody wish can be involved by investing money or without any investment time to time to his personal gain. Anybody can be involved in a social business to raise fund for any social cause. A social business must expend a certain % of the profit for the development of the locality where it operates, therefore, a social business would be a socially and environment-friendly entity. A social business will always work to create new social businesses. Social business will create one type of social ownership, contribute to increase the social capital, and finally serve the democratic environment._x000D_
The principles of social business _x000D_
_x000D_
1.	A social business always would be a profitable entity._x000D_
2.	It would be a joint entrepreneurship of a group of common people. _x000D_
3.	A social business must have to share it major profit (min. 50%) for its associate partners and for social cause._x000D_
4.	A business entity that is established by the donation or grant of a big business group or person, etc., would not be considered as social business._x000D_
5.	A social business must be socially transparent and honest tax payer. _x000D_
6.	A social business cannot be enlisted in capital market never at no time. _x000D_
7.	A social business cannot be done or involved any illegal business that goes against the people of the society. _x000D_
8.	A social business must expend a certain % of the profit for the development of the locality where it operates._x000D_
9.	A social business would be a social and environment-friendly entity._x000D_
10.	Finally, a social business will be designed in such a way that it can help to set up new social business entities and can be work as a Social Platform. Therefore, it will play a key role to increase the social capital.","The successful implementation will demonstrate a new kind of business to the world that can help to reduce the widening inequality gap, therefore, to reduce the poverty in a sustainable way. It will also show that a business can be for the benefit of a group of people instead of a few and for the society as well. This type of business will also help to create different types of social funds that can be used by the society, government, and even by the charity organizations. This business will help to increase social capital that is very urgent in a fragmented world. ",The widening inequality gap. TT

Now working with over 100 women groups, youth & minority lead local NGO’s and CBO’s in the country is facilitating two registered national levels networks.Poor quality of life, insufficient opportunities and exploitive conditions are few of the many problems faced by women’s in district Khushab. The causes behind this gender disparity include lack of awareness, resource constraints, social barriers and limited accessibility to health and educational facilities. The fact that a major portion of the country’s female population falls below the poverty line, health issues, malnourished and exhausted by backbreaking and multifaceted roles at household level and contribution to income generation activities, adds to their overall vulnerability. Like most rural areas of Pakistan, women of Union Council, Tehsil and District Khushab, Punjab are traditionally involved in household chores, taking care of children, working in the fields, managing the livestock, collecting fuel wood etc. In Pakistan women are facing many maternal problems like complications of pregnancy and childbirth remain the leading cause of death and disability for childbearing women in Pakistan. With a maternal mortality ratio of 297 per 100 000 live births. Pakistan is 1 of 6 countries contributing major maternal deaths worldwide. The widely endorsed strategies for promoting safe childbirth. Skilled birth attendance, with timely referral for emergency care in a well-functioning health care system—are reflected in Pakistan’s formal maternal health policy. the significant attempts to implement this policy have occurred, first under the Safe Motherhood and later the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) initiatives, with a degree of success in improving services_x000D_

We came to know about the Flourishing bilingual nursery and primary school because of the presence of our Food and Technology Division in Douala. That is our unit of food transformation and conservation for sales. We have collaborated previously with the Upper Room Christian Fellowship Douala, which is behind this school project, and our interest in helping the construction of the school lies in the fact that our presence in Douala has helped bring in people from the English speaking part of Cameroon who settled in this suburb area of Bonaberi.  The school was created as a response to the urgent, pushing and unfulfilled need of hundreds of children living in Ndobo – Bonaberi. Douala is the economic capital of Cameroon with more than 2.000.000 people, and as all thickly populated towns, it has attracted many persons from the other regions of Cameroon, who came looking for a better opportunity in life. It is a French speaking Region of Cameroon. We are now on the third generation of that immigration even from the English speaking part of Cameroon. These immigrants from other parts of Cameroon have settled in the suburbs because of less cost. Some of these areas are becoming ghettos and not served with facilities like schools, hospitals, public offices.... Children have been travelling for far distances to attend a nursery and a primary school, making it a huge problem for the parents’ pockets, for the physical health of the children and even for their security.  Children are reported missing and even involved in road accidents every day. The today’s parents are more conscious of the wellbeing of their children and have been the drive for the creating of the Flourishing Bilingual Nursery and Primary school. The school is ran in a rented wooden structure, without any sanitary facility, without any security and not even sufficient for the children. (pictures included) The school is ran by a set of professionals with a Christian background, who came together to render a quality service at a very moderate price for the parents. The quality of the education is very good, meanwhile the quality of the structure and what it offers is very poor. There is not enough space, the building is not quite accessible during the rainy seasons and there are no sanitary facilities. There is a big opportunity to provide a better facility for these children who are so many, given the fact that the land has already been acquired in that area and the school is already registered. The project aims to provide a low cost but solid structure for the English and French speaking children, that is, 2 nursery school classes French and English, 6 primary school classes French and English, making it 16 classes all together. A staff room has been foreseen so as to facilitate communication and work sharing between the teachers. This is because our experience for the past year has shown us that the exchange between staff members is very important for the proper running of the school. A multipurpose hall has also been foreseen so as to encourage recreational moments between the children, moments for devotion, or simply moments of sharing between the children. Water facilities have also been foreseen. It is difficult to find a water system toilet in our local schools, but we deem it very necessary to keep up the sanitary standards of the school, teaching and helping the children to been clean at their early ages. Many children in Cameroon die at an early age because of lack of good sanitary conditions. We did not forget an open playing space for the children of about 900 square metres. HELP ME I HELP YOU is a no profit organization which has been by the side of the Flourishing Bilingual School from the beginning, giving a helping hand with the updating training to the teachers involved. The school is autonomous and ran by a group of Christian qualified teachers headed by a professional with experience in the teaching field. The school will accept up to 40 children per class. Presently the school is running 2 in 1 classes because of lack of space. For example class one and two are in the same class. Class three and four are in the same class and so on. HELP ME I HELP YOU and the Flourishing Bilingual School are both contributing in kind and in cash for the success of this project. Even the Mayor of Douala 5, who rules Bonaberi, has given his accord for the provision of a better structure for the children of the suburb, and part of the funds will be demanded from the Douala 5 Council. The general community of Ndobo has appreciated very much the fact that the school offers teaching for both French and English speaking children. (please see the proposed plan of the school). We are going to used this money for the construction of the school structure._x000D_
",By December 2015 we aim to start the construction of the building. That before September 2016 the project should be finishing for school year in Cameroon start September.  We aim that children start using the newly construction classes by September 2016.the school now runs with 150 female children which after their basic education they will get to our computer school. we plan to finish the foundation by February  and the walls erection start that same February and by May the wall should be finish and by July the roofing should be finishing and the last phase wish is finishing take on till September for school to started.,"1.	The urgent, pushing and unfulfilled need of hundreds of children living in Ndobo – Bonaberi Immigrants from other parts of Cameroon have settled in the suburbs because of less cost. Children have been travelling for far distances to attend a nursery and a primary school, making it a huge problem for the parents’ pockets, for the physical health of the children and even for their security.  Children are reported missing and even involved in road accidents every day. without any sanitary facility, without any security and not even sufficient for the children. There is not enough space and not accessible during the rainy seasons and there are no sanitary facilities. Many children in Cameroon die at an early age because of lack of good sanitary conditions. Presently the school is running 2 in 1 classes because of lack of space. For example class one and two are in the same class. Class three and four are in the same class and so on.	OO"

For visually Impaired, Braille is an essential tool that aids in the process of becoming literate. Tape recorders and synthesized speech are useful tools, but they are inadequate substitutes for reading and writing. Braille literacy plays the same key role in a blind person's life that print literacy does in a sighted person's-it increases opportunities.  Our moto is to make the visually Impaired become more independent in this competitive world. Availability of books in Braille script is a very critical need for visually impaired students to continue their education. As such books are not provided by the Government beyond school level, NGOs have to step in to meet this requirement. Many Visually challenged students, especially girls, discontinue their studies just for the want of Braille books. Easy availability of books will enable students to complete their college education and get employed._x000D_
For this purpose we have procured an Automated Braille Transcription machine with mass production ability integrated with a library chain. This can be operated by any person with little technical ability; the beneficiaries are local blind and visually impaired students who are aspiring to continue their education and training.  This will help them to gain future employment and those who simply want to enhance their knowledge and enjoyment by way of reading books. Hence we request to you to provide us the funds for recurring expenditure for running and printing Braille books._x000D_

The story of girls Cibitoke pushes us to propose an intervention in their favor. following the conflicts experienced by the country for over 12 years, several orphans have not studied.

2015,14,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,,Stop Street Harassment ,Youth Organization United Toward Help,Afghanistan,Afghanistan,0,,"['Education', 'Environment & Sustainability']","In Afghanistan, street harassment is most common in cities, where women are more active. Ranging from insults to physical assault, street harassment has become one of the most common and noticeable methods of discouraging women from publicly participating in society. There have been several incidents of throwing acid on women's faces in Kabul, Herat, Juzjan and Qunduz. All these methods of harassment lead to loss of women's motivation to work and study.   A commonly-used Afghan proverb brutally says: 'A women's place is either her husband's house or her grave.' This common belief contributes not only to the street harassment of women, but also to the violence and abuse women face in families, schools, universities and workplaces.    _x000D_
However, as opposed to many other countries, in Afghanistan, street harassment is not recognized as a problem and a system to support and assist survivors of assault is non-existent. Members of the Afghan National Police often engage in harassment of women and, despite the fact that insulting women is considered a crime by the Law against Violence against Women, the issue of street harassment is not specifically identified or addressed._x000D_
Individual women have developed their own methods to fight street harassment. To deny the satisfaction of accomplishment to the violators, many women adopt a silent attitude towards the harassment they face. The silent treatment is a common way women choose to protect themselves and discourage the person who verbally abuses them. Another way of dealing with this problem has been initiation of the harassment by the women when they say something condescending to men, in order to prevent their harassment and to prove that they are not afraid of men's presence. Some women have verbal fights, or mini-fist-fights that usually end with the interference of an outsider._x000D_
These methods can be efficient in stopping a few cases of harassment. However, to efficiently stop street harassment, there needs to be a coordinated public movement against it.  Thus YOUTH will target boys specifically from high school and newly entrants to university by conducting baseline survey regarding their thoughts to street harassment, based on the research we will conduct trainings for both boys and girls on how to fight against street harassment. _x000D_
To better introduce the issue for public people YOUTH will arrange dialogues among boys and effected girls through media so they could better express their speeches to concern government authorities on the issues. _x000D_
Finally for long impact of the project YOUTH will establish friendly using website on which users can register their names both as person who is effected of street harassment and the person who could better provide advice on the mentioned issues. Registrars can better create their own advocacy networks through website.  _x000D_
","By end of the project we have the vision to train and give awareness 1000 high school girls and boys regarding how to fight against street harassment. Furthermore through this project young effected girls will  have the opportunity to directly participate in dialogues among boys, girls, religious leaders and government officials through media so they can waiver keeping silence while facing to street harassments. In addition effected individuals will have the opportunity to share their stories through website and create their own advocacy networks for fighting against street harassment. ","Gender-based street harassment limits people’s access to public spaces and lowers their comfort level there. It can cause people to “choose” less convenient routes and alter their routines; give up hobbies and change habits; and even quit jobs or move neighborhoods or simply stay home because they can’t face the thought of one more day of harassment. Unlike the harassment other demographics face (e.g. racial harassment, homophobic harassment, disability harassment), the street harassment of girls/women because of their gender is usually not taken seriously and few other groups address it. It’s seen as a joke, compliment, or their fault. In reality, street harassment limits women’s peace of mind and mobility, making it a gender equality and human rights issue. No country has achieved gender equality and no country ever will until street harassment ends. PF"

If they want do some income generation activity , they have no capital. Due to poor condition, the banks also do not provide credit. The major cause for such a situation is that all the women in the villages are primarily dependent upon their husband/father and on rain fed agriculture for their sustenance. There is no irrigation facility in villages of Sivanmalai  block of Tirupur District of Tamil Nadu . 60% women and girls are illiterate. The agriculture has now become uncertain because of climate change & untimely rainfall. This ultimately leads them to sit idle or to migrate to distant places in search of livelihoods as labor or maid servant, where they get further exploited.  Girls on the other hand are allowed to study till primary level and get drop out after it. It is because; the government primary schools are in their villages only up to class 5th. It is free and books are also given free of cost by the government. The high schools are only 3 to 4 in number in a block (amongst 200 to 300 villages) and situated about 3 to 5 kilometers from the village near block-headquarter or near market area. High school education is costly because of costlier books and some fee in the school. Poor parents hence do not send their girls to high school.  There are also no public transport in the villages nor are pitch roads. Hence parents do not allow their daughters to go far on foot due to fear of rape and bad law & order situation. Till they pass 5th, they become adolescent and married thereafter by the age of 14-16 years. The major cause for this is lack of money and a narrow attitude of parents towards girls. All the girls who are withdrawn from schools are made to work at their respective houses in cooking food, looking after kids and doing other house hold work. It is other way of child labor in her own house. Finally they are married at a very early age for which they are neither prepared physically nor psychologically.
