Gender imbalance is one of the key factors propagating poverty lack of ownership and control over production assets such as land by women is a factor that contributes to poverty. Also some traditions do not allow women to even have poverty registered in their names. This in turn limits their access to, education, information, communication, participatory, owner-women leadership democracy women status level, credit facilities due to take of collateral or security. It has been note that in many societies, material poverty interacts with gender based discriminations o that poor women's level of health, education and social participation are even lower than their male counterparts.The project will contribute to the carpe results, which need to provide and promote continuous professional development of gender equity education and training, man and women social leaders staff in order to adequately prepare them to facilitate the skills knowledge and attitudes required of secondary level students, not only for the demands of foster gender equity but also for their own further formation and self development. It integrates economic, physical environment community and human development in a comprehensive and coordinated fashion so that families and communities can work together and thrive. By increasing equity, capacity reducing exclusion discriminality and contributing at long term development, promote the lively hood of beneficiaries: 60 % of them will develop new skills, they will contribute to rising their simulation, reducing the root causes of their manipulation, poverty and helped them acquire citizenship, gender equity leadership development and apply the income generating activities in puts higher their social status and greater bargaining power.

The objectives that will be achieved are, monitoring, reporting and pleading, disseminating general information about gender disability reinforcing capacity of social leaders to make action, developing policy and plan that mitigate the impact of gender disability. These objectives will act as catalysts mobilize knowledge, skills, leadership and initiatives within a diverse global community to identify and eliminate the conditions that lead to massive women rights violence and gender disability.
It's important the women to be taken out of ignorance, because that is what binds them to poverty, diversities and others neglected. Once they re enlightened in terms of knowledge and information, it becomes easier to work with them for their betterment, by  empowering with understanding of women capacity for creativity, for political innovation, and for lives of peace full service to advance women dignity in every area of social life. The gender disability which affect us collectively and we must act collectively, to change them by integrating participatory, democracy gender, race, class, ethnic and setting permanent programs educate and training them and others vulnerable. This project will involve women in management and monitoring of basic house holder, health, environment and education service in community, in order to provide humanitarian aid to the neediest communities. By empowering the women to act participatory approaches provide the framework for formulating women simulation, inclusion, an important initiative of the program which can help women in poor households organize themselves for collective action, under supervision of women status. This training does not only take place in the training sale, or class room, but also in the field (village per village, site per site) practically and through exchange of experiences.

A training program for peer education, members is a guarantee of better democratic control and efficiency within the better organization to reach the main results, in education and training the women social leaders to develop self help leadership groups, laws and policy initiatives. By end those formed women to be capable of developing methods to communicate to all levels, general meeting, committees and working groups are the first instruments of the small publications in local languages reinforce the communication policy, women rights and citizen laws, decision making. The first priority in revitalizing distressed communities is to train the trainer's leader's women their sensitizing, information and education will empower opportunities: jobs equity, equality and works for all families or societies. The women education and training the trainer's women, both within the community and throughout the region or country provide the foundation on which families or societies will become economically self â€“ sufficient and communities can revitalize themselves.

Because educating a woman, is to educate all nations.

Women opportunities for entrepreneurial initiatives, small business, expansion and training for jobs that after up ward mobility one other key elements for providing livelihood, householder economic, this is mainly done through empowering the communities as well as individually  like women leadership by mitigating social exclusion focuses on the processes of marginalization specifically  it refers to the societal and institutional processes that exclude certain groups like women from full participation in the social economic, cultural and political life of societies.

While it is true that a person can be economically deprived without being socially excluded, social exclusion may lead to economic poverty directly, by means of lacking social net works, that provide opportunities, or indirectly via disparities in the power structures of social.

Which are the first critical steps toward the creation of a livable and vibrant community, where human initiative work and stable families can flourish

However, economic development can only be success full when part of a coordinated and comprehensive strategy that includes women physical development as well as human development is used. All societies  are built from women, social groups rather that individuals, and these groups determine attitudes, belief identities and values as well as access to resources and opportunities and ultimately. The expansion of assets and capabilities of women to participate in negotiate with influence, control and hold accountable institutions that affect their lives.

It is clear that power, as access to positions and institution that allow women to influence change for the interests of their groups is a requisite for the acquisition of voice in society, women social capital, social support and social net works can play an important role in world change to day. Promoting world change by promoting sustainable development, these are mainly done through empowering the communities as well as individuals, especially the women.

From my own experience
The inspiration came up during my professional internships as a student senior assistant social welfare officer of the National Institute of Social Work at the Bamenda Central Prison and in a private institution taking care of street children in 2007 and 2008. In fact in each of these institutions, I realized that children were undernourished and were developing many ills like stomach aches,diarrhea and other related diseases.Also, the various runaways and delinquency of those children were due to famine and poverty of their families. Being tough on how to make a very rich pap for children, elderly people and others, I developed the dream to make it and share to all those children suffering from extreme hunger, selling to the population and train families or individuals that wish to generate some revenues on the activity. Later on in my  private studies,and while producing with the small money i had, and selling, i discovered a miraculous medicinal and nutritive plant called Moringa and thought that it could more enrich the product and solve thus many health problems.

The project aims to establish a community radio station in the Community of Naogaon district which is located in the northern part of Bangladesh. The people of community have a distinct language which is not catered for by the national broadcaster. The project will facilitate access to information, particularly development information and contribute to social consciousness and participation in decision-making. 

The goal of the proposed project is to develop a living of standards life of community  to provide Information services to otherwise inaccessible communities within the Naogaon region. This innovative approach will provide a cost effective model for access to global knowledge resources and will facilitate the exchange of local knowledge, culture and experience.

 

â€¢        General objective

 

There are a growing number of models both in existence and in development that seek to bridge the â€˜digital divideâ€™ and engage marginal or excluded communities in the â€˜knowledge economyâ€™ by using new technologies and specifically the Community Radio. This initiative aims to harness the potential of new technologies and find solutions through the following goals:

 

â€¢       Develop an appropriate access model for rural and geographically remote areas to obtain access to information

â€¢       Publish localised content that is specific to the community needs and provides an avenue for discussion and dialogue in native languages via the radio.

â€¢       Reduce the feelings of isolation and promote interaction with the Naogaon community.

â€¢       Enhance economic development and alleviate poverty through educational and economic opportunities. 

â€¢       Identify new ways to generate wealth and provide new markets and distribution channels, reduce transaction costs and aggregate demand and buying power. 

â€¢       Provide cheap and alternative methods of communication within and between communities.

â€¢       Allow access to information and knowledge that can improve the lives and livelihoods of individuals and the community as a whole.

Develop a voice of Social entrepreneurship for social capital mobilization.

Activity m: Microenterprise Development

Rural farmers cannot create and maintain livelihoods without access to affordable capital and markets. NHRD MicroFund program would provides micro grants and concomitant business development services to thirteen community-based organizations (CBOs) in northern part of Bangladesh whose members are engaged in agro-based micro enterprise activities, thus enhancing food security and reducing poverty.  The CBOs have created revolving loan funds, which can be tapped for investment in member-owned micro enterprises some of which include milk processing, fish and poultry farming, oil processing, vegetable gardening and goat-tending.  

Activity n: Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG)

In the Bangladeshâ€™s, thousands suffered near starvation following the collapse of the  agriculture sector in the 1954s.  Poor nutrition is still prevalent and particularly harmful to school-aged children in rural areas, resulting in low educational achievement and stunted growth. NHRDA will utilize Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG) technology whereby a small area of land is intensively cultivated using natureâ€™s own ingredients to rebuild and then maintain the soilâ€™s productivity.  Starting in 2013, NHRDA will began a â€˜BIG Intensification Programâ€™ that has brought BIG technology, health and nutrition education directly into the classrooms and compounds of over 1156000 poor women, rural schools in the Naogaon district, thus reducing malnutrition and providing life-long agricultural skills to communities.



Development approaches of NHRDA and BR:

Facilitate peopleâ€™s participation in need assessment, planning, and implementation of activities.

Assist community organization for sustainability of development process, mobilization, and optimum utilization of local resources.

Develop and promote local voluntary activities through a group of volunteers.

Stimulate and encourage development of human potentials for self-improvement.

Initiate, develop, and implement demonstrative projects; experiment innovative ideas; conduct action research.

Mediate and confer among donors, Govt. and other development organizations as a part of regular policy advocacy for desired social changes.

Develop strong organizational network for sharing experiences and obtaining services for sustainable development.



Implementation Strategy:

NHRDA implements different activities either by receiving supports Development Partner organization or in partnership with other organizations. Community participation, networking, linkage, membership, and gender sensitization are considered in the implementation process. NHRDA materializes its mission and vision encompassing components of a certain program or integrating different components of two or more programs. In case of intervention, program activities are carried out through field offices. NHRDA gives importance to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). BR will provide access to information for community.

Social entrepreneurship is the work of social entrepreneurs. A social entrepreneur recognizes a social problem and uses entrepreneurial principles to organize, create and manage a venture to achieve social change (a social venture). Whereas a business entrepreneur typically measures performance in profit and return, a social entrepreneur focuses on creating social capital. Thus, the main aim of social entrepreneurship is to further social and environmental goals. However, whilst social entrepreneurs are most commonly associated with the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors, this need not necessarily be incompatible with making a profit.

Women Victimâ€™s Associations and their motivating force: Door-to-Door Campaign against Trauma (DDCAT). The NHRDA works with the aim to completely rehabilitate victims of VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN and in doing so, they strongly believed that for full recovery, the victims in common area must band together to assist one another emotionally and economically as well as raise awareness about torture and human rights abuses in their own rural communities.  This is accomplished through Victimâ€™s Associations (VAâ€™s) and can therefore be thought of as a preventative measure as well as a curative one.  The idea of VAâ€™s dawned on Mr. Akram Chowdhury after noticing how empowered and confident torture victims felt after treatment sessions that included the use of the Door to Door Campaign against Trauma (DDCAT). NHRDAâ€™s Door to Door Campaign against Torture (DDCAT), a simple tool of human rights education for rural communities is a separate yet equally important preventive initiative run by the organization. The DDCAT is an extremely unique and effective means of spreading human rights awareness.  It is a slogan that combines elements of the constitution, the Convention against Torture, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Qurâ€™an and local laws to provide a message of how torture is prohibited by all these laws and what is the true responsibility of the police force.  The DDCAT is designed to be chanted at meetings and in public venues such as markets where it can be heard by all members of the community, even those who are illiterate.  The victims showed an interest to continue DDCAT back in their communities and the VA was born. BR will provide the DDCAT for community empowerment.

Project sustainability

 

The project will provide free access to a limited number of poor and marginalized target groups and communities. The extended network capabilities can subsidise operating costs by charging individuals, business, government and non government agencies for these services at a competitive rate. The project design will include the development of strategies to minimize ongoing costs such as equipment maintenance, connectivity and electricity charges.  Even when internet connectivity is not available the project design will also ensure a robust network that can provide localised emergency and health services, email. The planning and implementation draws heavily on the experience of staff and management from NHRDA.  Their commitment and guidance will ensure the project translates into appropriate outcomes relevant to the communities needs.

Sustainability:

This section looks at how Community Radio-for-rural-livelihood projects and programs can be set up in ways that continue to support livelihoods strategies in the longer term. This can be achieved by concentrating on: ownership, partnerships, involvement, capacity building, local innovations, and a cross-sectoral approach.

Current knowledge base includes:

ï€ Multi-stakeholder partnerships and networks are recognized as important aspects of the enabling environment and can support community-driven initiatives.

To facilitate participatory, broadcasting-aware rural initiatives, it is recognized that a range of stakeholders need to work together. ï€ Intermediaries should have a stake in the local community. BR interventions must build on existing systems, including information content (indigenous knowledge, local sources and databases), information technology (radio, telephone, internet), processes (existing surveys, research and extension), and policy environment. ICTs should be built into existing structures and should recognise the existing but less formal communication arenas.

ï€ In poorer countries, local community control and participation is widely recognized as critical to the success of ICT projects, such as tele-centers and application development. Community ownership works best when supported by well organized local institutions and where ICT demand emerges from community livelihood needs.

ï€ When an community radio project is cutting across sectors, it is likely to be more sustainable. Sustainable funding models require that the funding of a project must have clear objectives and an institutional framework.

ï€ The Mobile is a sustainable mobile communication service that has helped to create small business and provide connectivity to the rural areas. With the aid of microfinance loans, entrepreneurs can become Village Phone Operators, allowing them to buy the equipment they need to provide telecommunication services to villages.

Sustainable Livelihoods and Communication

The shift in development theory from modernization to dependency led to a rethinking of how communications can be harnessed for development. In the 1970s, multilateral organizations such as FAO began to implement two-way knowledge flows and information exchange between rural communities and technocrats, rather than one-way transfer of knowledge. This recognition that development comprises of more than just increased productivity led to alternative development approaches, such as the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) approach in the 1990s. The approach is centered on people and their livelihoods. It prioritizes people's tangible and intangible assets, and their ability to withstand shocks in the vulnerability context. It also prioritizes policies and institutions that reflect poor people's priorities, rather than those of the elite (Chambers and Conway 1991). Many multilateral, bilateral, and non-government agencies believe that using an SL approach is a sensible and practical way of thinking about planning and implementing development. Key elements of the approach have been used in a variety of development agencies ranging from bilaterals and multilaterals to international NGOs. 

SL approach as: ï€ a more realistic understanding of poor people's livelihoods and the factors that shape them; ï‚•ï€ building a policy and institutional environment that supports poor peopleâ€™s livelihoods; and ï€ supporting development that builds on the strengths of poor people and provides them ith opportunities to improve their livelihoods. The core principles underlying the approach are that poverty-focused development should be:

1. People-centered. Sustainable poverty elimination will be achieved only if external

support focuses on what matters to people, understands the differences between

groups of people and works with them in a way that is congruent with their current

livelihood strategies, social environment, and ability to adapt.

2. Responsive and participatory. Poor people themselves must be key actors

in identifying and addressing livelihood priorities. Outsiders need processes to listen

and respond to the poor.

3. Multi-level. Poverty elimination is an enormous challenge that can be overcome only

by working at multiple levels, ensuring that micro-level activity informs

the development of policy and an effective enabling environment, and that macrolevel

structures and processes support people to build upon their own strengths.

4. Conducted in partnership. With both the public and the private sectors;

5. Sustainable. .There are four key dimensions to sustainability - economic, institutional, social and environmental sustainability. A holistic approach is essential with a balance between the different dimensions.

At the end of the project 

â€¢	A community radio station established and functioning;

â€¢	Mass awareness on health & nutrition, drinking safe water, proper sanitation, maintaining hygiene, primary immunization, family planning, maternity care, human rights, torture and violence against women and child, violence against tribal women, promoting local government activities launched by the government, promotion & development of local agriculture products, promotion and marketing linkage of handicraft produc, gengerequity, minority rights, labour rights, religious rights, womwn and child rights, and the child development through child club, community empowerment through DDCAT, 100% child education ensure through child club, child development centre, telecentre, radio program, farmers field university created among minimum the rural community living inNaogaon district.

Since, in Pakistan we have man dominated society. Women do not have any say in this society. Every day we witness in-justice with women in newspaper and electronic media in Pakistan. Moreover, I have also worked with a project of UNDP here in Quetta Pakistan. The project name is Area Development Program Balochistan. A poverty alleviation program of UNDP, WFP and Government of Balochistan. We used to form community organizations of men and women in rural areas of Balochistan. In rural areas men even do not call the name of their female family members before strangers. Women do not have any authority over the income of her husband. Beating women brutally is a common in rural areas of Balochistan. There are such areas where women do not have the right to eat meat. Meat is only male members of family. So urban areas are also affected with such cruel thinking and attitude. Beside rural areas, in urban areas we also witness the honor killing of women, throwing acid, rape and other incidents with innocent women.

So these worse conditions with women have compelled me to thank for the development and empowerment of women of Quetta Pakistan.

Every day in Harare, I see around me the especially heavy burden women carry when poverty and injustice have robbed them of their dignity.

I have seen over the past year of living here, that equipping young women to gain formal employment, and/or to set up their own businesses through using their own skills and ingenuity, has had a profound effect on their lives and those of their families.  As a result of their training, our graduates not only have sustainable income - enabling them to eat better, live in better environments, pay for school fees, medicine and new clothes - but their overall self-confidence and demeanor is irrevocably changed too.

The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favor of women. Empowerment is the one of the key factors in determining the success of development is the status and position of women in the society. We put a special focus on empowering women and girls, because we believe they hold the key to long-lasting social change in communities. Empowering women must be a united approach, a cause that requires continued attention and stewardship by all. We need to augment our efforts for empowering women and enhance their progress. It is our moral, social and constitutional responsibility to ensure their progress by providing them with equal rights and opportunities. Today women with their smartness, grace and elegance have conquered the whole world. They with their hard work and sincerity have excelled in each and every profession. Women are considered to be more honest, meticulous, and efficient and hence more and more companies prefer hiring women for better performance and result.

To accomplish great things we must not only act, but also dream, not only plan but also believe
Having grown up in a family where inspiration, motivation and belief in one's abilities were key to success, i derive my inspiration first from the family structure. How the family has molded me, from the first days of my preschool life, up to where i am right now. Looking mainly at how my own mother is hard working, and has been able to instill that hard work onto us has made me realize that the only person that can stop me from achieving my goals is me, and that what i can dream and believe in, i certainly can achieve. I also look at my own personal interactions in life, the people whom i look up to, and in turn, those who look up to me, and that alone makes me realize that i am who i am because of the relationships that i establish with other people, friends, relatives, and my girlfriend. As one with a strong moral and christian background, i also get my inspiration from how Jesus lived his life, so pure, so true,   giving us the moral lesson in life that i am my brother's keeper. That in itself always inspires me to dedicate all i do to the greater good of mankind, putting others first before i put my own interests. Lastly, one of my greatest inspirations has come from the work place environment. Being involved in an amazing organisation, which has team work and team motivation as key to its success. Also, working under an amazing, motivational and inspirational Executive Director who herself has been awarded an Ashoka Fellowship in recognition of her work in rural poverty alleviation clearly lives me in a position where i am inspired to emulate her work, and allow myself to follow in her footsteps. The first steps i have already started taking, as i was recently selected to be a Spark* Changemaker, pushing forward the concept of waste recycling and how it can be a game changer in developing communities and alleviating poverty. Changemakers are inspired, they believe that a challenge is in fact an opportunity to achieve great works. With the inspirational summit held in Johannesburg in May 2012, my mindset has clearly shifted, and i came out of the summit more than inspired and prepared to bring about change in the community, in the country, in Africa and beyond!
For many decades now, Africa has been largely doomed with the negative perception that women and girls in particular are meant to be regarded as 'second class citizens' in communities, especially the conservative rural communities. At the same time, most of these rural communities are characterized by high poverty rates owing to a lack of availability of resources from which an income can be derived. Being one person who has developed a keen interest in social entrepreneurship as an empowerment tool for rural poverty alleviation, i believe there is no other way to go but to focus primarily on women's groups and organisation as through the PEACE Foundation's experience with our project beneficiaries, women have that track record of making things happen in all of our cooperatives. This will in turn remove all the negative barriers on women empowerment in society and as i believe, will bring about that positive change in society. Apart from this, all the people who have positively played big roles in molding my life have been women, and hence, for me, women empowerment becomes something very personal and dear. "

Indeed, post-pubescent girls are often missing school as many as five days each month due to inadequate menstrual care. Other activities such as work, chores and playing with other children are also restricted. In rural locations and in very destitute area, the impact of menstruation upon the girls is particularly noticeable, since there are no, or very poor and inadequate, toilet or washing facilities and no real privacy. Sometimes,in very rural areas, the girls have to walk several hours or more to attend school: this is impossible for them when they have their period, if they donâ€™t have adapted sanitary pads.

Liberia is a country in West Africa that is just returning from wanton devastation of lives and properties for over 14 years of civil war, and has just ended its second post war elections that brought on   board Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as President again. The country has low level of women and girls participation in both national and local levels  decision making, more  women and girls are  been  marginalized  at all levels,  such problems   are leading women and  girls to get involved in activities   that do not support moral acts.
Literacy development program for  abused, insecure women and girls in particular are characterized by overall low productivity of small and large scale community based literacy program for the purpose   of producing  broad based improvement in literacy skills have been inaccessible, unattainable and virtually the  same in  both cases, and very little public value. The 1990-2003 devastated civil violent conflict and economic crisis have dexterously affected the quality and access to schooling. Discrimination reduces opportunities and incentives to acquire literacy learning among socially disadvantage groups. Literacy in Liberia is prominent among native born Liberians women and girls due to strong tradition, culture, and the unwholesome war that fought over 14 years. The lack of support for special needs further exacerbates lieteracy problems among these groups.  Adults whose mother tongue is different from the language or instruction tend to have lower literacy levels.  Most adult literacy programs are fare below Africa and world Averages.
Women needs to be empowered because women our mothers who should have every thing to their need. Women should get involve with decision making with their peers males.  Women are over the past time have been marginalized in Liberia due to bad traditional practics, holding to that fact that women can get marry without education and will be suppoorted by man, such practtics has  greatly affectd most Liberian women and Girls.

The UNâ€™s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that if women farmers have equal access to fertilizers, seeds, and tools, the number of hungry people in our world could reduce by as many as 150 million, and the total agricultural output in developing countries could rise by up to four percent.

Involving women in ways to resolve conflict is not just an exercise in gender equality, it's a key strategy to improve the chances of peace.

The evidence shows that the more involved women are as peace-builders, the greater the likelihood of lasting peace.



Women need to be key players in conflict prevention and peace-building, conflict management and reduction, and post-conflict recovery.

Helen Hakena, from the Leitana Nehan Women's Development Agency in Bougainville explains, 'Women worked [during the war] and collected all the pieces and put those pieces together but in peace we are not included. Women are not passive victims, we are contributing actively to peacemaking. Imagine what more we could do if we women were able to take an equal place at the negotiating table.'

Men and women experience war differently. This 'gendering' of war is apparent with the widespread use of rape as a weapon. In Darfur, Sudan, for example, women of all ages have been raped or experienced sexual violence, with family members often forced to witness their humiliation and distress. Darfuri women risk rape and violence not only when fleeing their homes, but also in some cases when collecting firewood or water in and around refugee camps. It is an irony that these camps that exist to protect refugees often become sites of further violence.

Women, as mothers, wives, grandmothers and daughters bear most of the burden for social security within the household and community. Women and children also comprise the majority of the civilian casualties of war - they make up over 80 per cent of the world's refugees. Yet it is essential that women are not seen only as victims of war, but also as the decision-makers in peace-building.

'The issue of equal participation by women is not simply an issue of gender equality and human rights but could represent the decisive factor in maintaining peaceful development in a troubled region,' says L.Seyoum from Eritrea.

Promoting women's roles in leading community reconstruction is advocated by the United Nations in the Security Council Resolution 1325 which 'reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and peace-building and equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.'

In response to the current crisis in Darfur, the International Women's Development Agency is seeking to help the wider development community to integrate gender considerations into emergency operations. Areas that have been addressed to date are firewood and fuel collection; the psychological effects of gender based violence, and reproductive health. These gender considerations can be found on the IWDA website and can be used freely. Any feedback is welcome.

Unfortunately, the issue of conflict and reconstruction look set to increase over the next decade. Let's hope we can use our skills, knowledge and technological advances to assist women and their families maximize their roles as peace-builders in the reconstruction of their communities.


The Convention On The Elimination Of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women is an important tool for addressing the human rights of rural  women as well as elimination of discrimination they face  throughout their lifespan. women will express their concerns about the lack of statistical data disaggregated by sex, abuse, neglect, violence against rural women and insecurity in financial, medical and housing needs including exclusion from national ID network, which cumulatively expose them to multiple forms of discrimination. 
There are so many legislations and practices in different countries that discriminate against rural women. For example many rural women from rural areas and minority communities in south Sudan do not have access to ID cards and any allowances that are provided by the Government. It is therefore imperative that States Parties review legislation and practice through both a gender related perspective and take appropriate action.



 Governments should collect statistical data disaggregated by sex and age on the situation of rural  women illiteracy, with indicators on poverty, illiteracy, violence against women, health and housing related issues including care givers for  HIV/AIDS, migrant/retuness women, rural women, women living in areas of conflict and  women belonging to minorities, and disabled women.





 Negative stereotyping of rural women and traditional harmful practices can be manifested in various forms of rural women abuse and violence. Governments should encourage the media to correct negative attitudes towards rural women and project positive images of rural  women regarding their contribution to their families and society as a whole.











Rural  women are often discriminated against in terms of participation in public and political positions as well as decision-making positions. Age specific public policies could open opportunities for rural women to participate fully and effectively in the political, economic and social spheres of their societies.





The illiteracy rates amongst rural women are often high especially in rural areas. This illiteracy level is compounded by gender discrimination which seriously limits rural womenâ€™s access to information on their rights and their ability to participate in development and community activities. Access to vocational adult education or basic literacy and life skills training are very important to protect their rights as well as ensure access to the basic services.







Many rural women illiteracy  face discrimination in the work place and are compelled to work in low paid or part time jobs without income security. Very few rural illiteracy women have access to pensions.  Retirement ages also may differ between men and women.  Many rural women due to care giving responsibilities in the family bear the financial penalty of low pensions because of their absence in the labour market. They also bear the physical and emotional cost of stress from balancing work and care giving obligations. States Parties need to take appropriate measures to address these issues.





Access to affordable or free health care services is very important for older women in order to enjoy a satisfactory standard of mental and physical health. Post menopausal difficulties and diseases, neglect in disability and absence of geriatric medicine requires special attention. States Parties should adopt a comprehensive health policy.



The feminization of poverty is very common among rural  women due to unequal access to credit and labour markets, unequal remuneration and unremunerated work at home. Governments should provide special support systems and collateral-free micro credit as well as encourage micro entrepreneurship for rural women.





 Special programmes should be tailored to address the physical, mental, emotional, and health needs of rural women in rural areas with special focus on women belonging to minorities, migrant/retuness women, women living in areas of conflict and women with disabilities.



 In many countries the state of widowhood or being single due to divorce or never having been married profoundly changes rural womenâ€™s status in society and can result in discrimination both in law and in practice, particularly in terms of property and inheritance rights. Women from minority group suffer more due to above difficulties.

micro-loan facilities to economically less advantaged rural dwellers the main problem with single women (widow, unmarried girls due to dowry problem, disabled girls) and unemployed young women in the Igbepa,sagamu,iwelepe,atoyo,ibelefun,ogijo,agele,makun,offin,ajegunle$iwade . They are very much neglected in the family and have problem of surviving. If they want do some income generation activity, they have no capital. Due to poor condition, the banks also do not provide credit._x000D_
The major cause for such a situation is that all the women in the villages are primarily dependent upon their husband/father and on rain fed agriculture for their sustenance. There is no irrigation facility in villages of Igbepa,sagamu,iwelepe,atoyo,ibelefun,ogijo,agele,makun,offin,ajegunle$iwade 60% women and girls are illiterate. The agriculture has now become uncertain because of climate change & untimely rainfall. This ultimately leads them to sit idle or to migrate to distant places in search of livelihoods as labor or maid servant, where they get further exploited. _x000D_
Girls on the other hand are allowed to study till primary level and get drop out after it. It is because; the government primary schools are in the villages only up to primary 5. The high schools are only 3 to 4 in number in a block (amongst 20 to 30 villages) and situated about 3 to 5 kilometers from the village headquarter. High school education is costly because of costlier books and some fee in the school. Poor parents hence do not send their girls to high school. _x000D_
There is also no public transport in the villages most are pitch roads. Igbepa, sagamu, iwelepe, atoyo, ibelefun, ogijo, agele, makun, offin, ajegunle$iwade is full of forests and hills. Hence parents do not allow their daughters to go far on foot due to fear of rape and order situation. When they pass primary 5, they become adolescent and are married thereafter by the age of 14-16 years. The major cause for this is lack of money and a narrow attitude of parents towards girls. All the girls who are withdrawn from schools are made to work at their respective houses in cooking food; looking after kids and doing other house hold work. It is other way of child labor in her own house. Finally they are married at a very early age for which they are neither prepared physically nor psychologically. _x000D_
Therefore xenal enterprises support the single women and unemployed young women with credit (income generation activities). The amount given is. #25,000 to #100,000 by which they can enhance their income through goatary, poultry, piggery, grocery shop, tea-stall etc in which the women are competent enough to run their business themselves with little a training. The amount repaid was given as loan to other poor women for some business. Thus it goes on revolving and benefiting more and more women for years and years._x000D_
The micro-credit loan was at 1% interest rate (called service charge). Thus by advancing a loan of us with a grant of $25,000 (800 to 1000) women would get livelihoods, reducing their poverty. And more villages will benefit from the micro credit empowerment the service charge obtained was using used to pay the salary of the single staff involved in micro-credit program._x000D_
The rest 50% of the service charge is used to sponsor adolescent girls at the rate of. #9,000 to one girl for school fee, books-copy-pen, dress etc per term. For high school education for one year with a written agreement with their parents that they will not marry her till she passes SS3, by which she becomes approximately 18 years of age. Till date none of the parents break this agreement. If anybody will try to break this agreement then they will have to return the entire amount being provided by the organization for education the girls are sponsored in group of 4 to 5 in one villages so that they can go together and parents will have no objection.

The girls were selected for sponsorship on the following criteria:_x000D_
1. one who belongs to economically backward situation specially children of widow, single women._x000D_
2. The girl who has willingness to study. Thus through xenal empowerment solves both the problems by improving socio-economic condition of poor rural women -. The girls who attend high school have various benefits over those who have not got the chance to enter school. The benefits are: _x000D_

Throughout the world, women are vital economic players. Hundreds of millions of women are undertaking critical roles in industry, agriculture, manufacturing, and services. In every country, women face the particular challenges of their national context, especially in developing economies._x000D_
Simply put, women play a central role in sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction and represent the largest economic force in the world. Encouraging more women to become involved in enterprise and grow existing business has significant potential to impact positively on the countryâ€™s economic performance. _x000D_
Micro, small and medium-sized businesses provide the bulk of employment for most economies, whether advanced or not. A considerable body of research has explored how women are at the centre of relationships that include family, business and community. _x000D_
In other words, when a woman starts or acquires her own business, in her view, she is not creating a separate economic entity; rather, she is integrating a new global system bringing together all elements. Women are simply more likely to work for, buy from, and share their economic and non-economic rewards with other people. To put it more explicitly, in economic terms, investment in womenâ€™s entrepreneurship is an important way for countries to exponentially increase the impact of new ventures creation._x000D_
Ignoring the potential of women entrepreneurship means that countries put themselves at a disadvantage and thwart their opportunity to increase economic growth.

â€œLiteracy is a bridge from misery to hope. It is a tool for daily life in modern society. It is a bulwark against poverty, and a building block of development, an essential complement to investments in roads, dams, clinics and factories. Literacy is a platform for democratization, and a vehicle for the promotion of cultural and national identity. Especially for girls and women, it is an agent of family health and nutrition. For everyone, everywhere, literacy is, along with education in general, a basic human right....

Entrepreneurship is what will sustain any project or initiative to empower women and girls. The project has to be a business, serving a need and generating income to support decent living earnings so that women will have financial freedom and independence. Empowerment is more than just financial freedom and means giving women the opportunity to do something they can be proud of and take ownership of. Every woman deserves a chance to be great and achieve anything her heart desires. All of us who have achieved what we want were given a lucky break at some stage. Working to empower other women and girls is a chance to give back and improve the lives of others around us, for the betterment of them and society as a whole. 
Since I have become aware of human trafficking, I have seen and heard about many individuals who have dedicated their lives to helping others. As an only child growing up in Africa with divorced parents I am deeply moved by individual efforts to help women achieve independence and success because I resonate with women wanting more for themselves and their families. It is the vulnerability of women and girls that predators take advantage of and what leads to so many being exploited. The fact is that all of us at some time in our lives have been vulnerable merely because we strive to achieve. It is this that makes me realize just how lucky some of us are and this is my source of motivation to help while drawing from the inspiration of others who are doing so much already.

I am so lucky that I could go to college and could do what I want to do. In my country, I have seen many women, who are very intelligent, but did not have a chance to go to college. They end up working hard, but earn much less than men do. The reason is due to persistent patriarchal norms at the village level, which have been virtually excluded women from high return jobs. Further, due to the persistence of patriarchal values, men are always respected and women are disregarded. As such, parents always choose to send their sons, instead of daughters, to school for higher education. Many women have to give up their dreams, stay at home or get married at a very early age. I have a strong belief that the best way to help them to pursue higher education and build a better life in the society is to help them become more economically independent. Through entrepreneurship, women will have opportunities to connect with wider social and economic systems in the region and as a result, they can build up their communicating, marketing and negotiating skills, an experience that they have never gone through themselves. Therefore, I am confident that entrepreneurship is one of the most efficient ways to help women and girls improve their status and gain more respect from the society.   
My mother is my personal source of inspiration. Although it is very common in our country that parents often impose their ideas on their children, my mother has never done that to me. She always gives me her opinions and good pieces of advices when I encounter any problem. However, she lets me make the final decision myself, which has later turned me into an independent girl. While the majority of women at her age consider boys more important than girls, she is not influenced by the ideology and this explains why everyone is equal in my family. My brother and I always share or take turn to do the housework to help my parents. My mother is a great mom. Although she is very smart, she did not have the opportunity to go to college, since my grand parents were so poor that they could not afford to send her to college . As a result, she has been working so hard to make sure that my brother and I could go to college.  She is a role model to me.  That explains why I always want to help every woman so that they will be well-educated and successful, and more importantly recognized by the society.

The Osiligi project gives hope to young Maasai Girls who have been circumcised, married off and those about to undergo this. Our objective is to equip the Girls with entrepreneurial skills which will help in poverty alleviation, one of the driving factors of early marriages. Community elders will also be taught on disadvantages of circumcision so as to curb these practices completely._x000D_
",,"
African progress toward achieving gender equality and women empowerment has been modest especially in reserved cultures like the Maasai. Having come from the Maasai community myself, I have witnessed many difficulties that women face. They are considered inferior to men and are not allowed to make any decisions for themselves. This has led them to believe that they cannot survive on their own and therefore making them fully dependent on men.  They have no right to express themselves or make any choices even on important issues affecting them like education, employment, property ownership, marriage and so on._x000D_
This perception has resulted in women being subjected to rampant discrimination and harsh traditional practices without any opportunity to defend themselves. This in turn has led to illiteracy among women, sexual and gender based violence, lack of economic opportunities and political participation. Such insights are unacceptable and against human rights which is an essential component in any democratic society. _x000D_
I believe that women empowerment is crucial in any society that seeks to achieve prosperity. This is because as women progress everyone in the society benefits including men. The first step to be taken in breaking the traditional notion that women are inferior is to empower women socially, economically and politically so that they can exploit their potential. There is also need to establish both community and national plans and strategies to take gender issues into account._x000D_

My parents are my greatest source of inspiration. This is because they defied the notion in my community that education is not worthy and instead, they worked hard to educate me and my five siblings. They always encourage us to move forth and achieve our dreams and are always there for us when we need them. Despite criticism from community members, they refused to adhere to appalling cultural practices like female circumcision and early marriage. Instead, they gave us the key to life; education. They treated all of us equally and not according to our gender. I am who I am today because of them.

Our usage and custom disadvantage the participation of girl and woman in activities which can empowerment themselves. They are not well considered and do not listen especially in rural area of Madagascar. They have no much education and consequently, cannot have a job that they would like to have. In some case, especially during this crisis, some parents exchange their daughter for money or zebu in order to help the family. However, only these little women pay the high price of this action. In order to help them, a long term activities is very welcome and entrepreneurship is the tool for reaching their goal. This will also a manner to sensitize and change the morality of population. 
My personal source inspiration is my Father. He was born in a very poor rural area of Antsirabe, was orphan and was very poor. So, he gone to Antananarivo and became one of their homeless people. Fortunately, a man helped him and gave home and education. As hard worker, he succeeds in his life. He helps many populations in rural area of his country of birth. Actually, I would like to follow his voice and want to help more people of my country through the creation of project where vulnerable people have chance for improvement of their life.
I leave in Madagascar and do many fieldworks through my job. I saw that in rural area, the usages and customs is very important. Many customs authorizes that daughters are exchange by a zebu. Unfortunately, some men seem to find benefits on it. This is very extreme in Lokaro where I find many girls less than 15 ages whose have a baby. They are leaved by their supposed husband without anything when they give birth. As young mother, I think that it is very regrettable because some of them would like to follow their study and to find a good job.

I believe that women and girls have a key role in the development process of a nation who wants to build a fair and strong society. Women in Cameroon have always been relegated to an inferior social status and her place has always been considered to be in the kitchen. My mother, just to name this one example I best know, suffered a lot from this injustice. Her courage and strength has been a great lesson for me, because despite her low level of education and her advanced age, she struggled to set up a small business which helps her care for her needs and that of her small family today. Now I know that empowering women can accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction in underdeveloped country like ours. So I decided to use a great portion of my time to work on women empowerment issues, especially women entrepreneurship.
Naturally, and first of all, my dear mom. I have met a lot of women and girls in my experience as a community volunteer. Most of them being very passionate about creating a better world around them. Each time I worked or carry out an activity with alongside women or girls, I learned something, I got inspired by them. I can say that all these little and everyday inspiration gathered constitute my greatest inspiration today. I must add that I have been particularly inspired by our great leader, NELSON MANDELA, from whom I learned that all we need to create change, to impact our personal lives and that of our entourage is a little bit of courage and strong will.

In rural Tanzania and my community in particular, women form the majority of the agriculture labour force and a lot of households are female headed.

Rwanda's Population is predominantly young and the majority is female.

A Rwanda woman has an average of six babies in her life (Interim Demographic and Health Survey/IDHS, 2007/2008). The high fertility rate and population density contribute to development and economic constraints, and depletion of natural resources._x000D_

The IRDHS reported that 22.2% of females and 17.5 of males between 15-24 years have no education, 66.2% of females and 67.6% of males in the same age group attained primary education while only 11.6% of female and 14.9% of males in the same age bracket attained secondary education. Adolescents and young adults, in particular those out of school face limited employment option. As a result, most are engaged in low paying jobs due to limited skills. Inevitably, a scarcity of decent jobs and employment for youth, particularly for out-of-school adolescents and young adults makes them prone to vulnerability an exposure to exploitation. Harmful traditional practices which interfere with adolescent growth and development are not well documented in Rwanda._x000D_

I want to prove that we can work together successfully and support and learn from each other. I want women to educate themselves and earn a proper livelihood so that they can see beyond these smaller matters of life and focus on the larger picture and in turn help to give more women and girls a brighter future.

Personally, I have been most inspired by a Bengali novel Anandamath written by Bankim Chandra Chatterji.  The story is set in the background of a Sannyasi Rebellion in the late 18th century during Indiaâ€™s struggle for Independence. The story represents India as Bharat Mata (Mother India) and compares it with 3 goddesses, representing What Mother (India) Was, What Mother Has Become and What Mother Will Be. This is one of the most influential novels in Bengali literature (my mother tongue) and my personal favourite. The compelling and elusive vision of what our Mother will be in the future is something which inspires me to work towards a developed and empowered nation."

Great things are not done on impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.
Vincent van Gogh
The late Steve Jobs. Although I am not a technology buff, Steve Jobâ€™s taught me three things that has been so indispensable when it comes to development work and empowering rural women._x000D_
_x000D_
First, a new idea tends to face resistance because people think, â€˜since it has not been done before, why do you think it will work?â€. NDI faced resistance from many people when we first introduced the idea of Project Light. Some asked why we must get rural women to pay for the lamps. Others say silly things like they will run away with the items and we will not be able to find them .Some said that only established and resource-rich groups can get such projects off the ground. I learnt to ignore such comments and push ahead, because even if I fail, the process of failing provides fertile ground to learn and create a more robust system. We did indeed encountered some failures in the process but turns out, the key learning point was not failing, but how well you adapt and rescue the process from irreversible failure. In short, as beautifully put by The New Yorkerâ€™s Atul Gawande, its not about failure, but about the â€œmastery of rescueâ€. _x000D_
_x000D_
Second, always place values at the forefront of your mission and work and do not compromise even as the organization grows. For Apple, Jobâ€™s value has always been to design and create beautiful products first, with the profit motive coming in second. The decline of Apple in the 90s occurred when Apple placed the profit motive first and great products second. I have always believed that for NDI to grow and make a greater impact, we need to maintain the purity of our values and mission. There have been instances where well -meaning people had asked us to increase the price of the solar lamps so that we can be â€˜financially sustainableâ€™ faster. This approach will give us a short term profit gain but in the long run, compromise our ability to reach out to more rural people who do not have much disposable income._x000D_
_x000D_
Third, I learnt the importance of passion. Jobs once said, â€œYou need a lot of passion for what youâ€™re doing because it is so hard. Without passion, any rational person would give up.â€ The work we do is difficult, consume a lot of time and may not be appreciated. During rational moments, you may ask yourself, â€˜Why am I am doing this?

The Late Prof. Wangari Maathai, environmentalist activist who became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004
I was born and brought up in Kaptembwa, one of the largest slum areas located in Nakuru, Kenya. However, when I was young, it wasnâ€™t a slum yet, it was the most beautiful place with a large number of trees. But then due to rise in human population, it became home to an estimated 140,000 people. I am very lucky that my parents moved out of the area to a well to do place in 2007 just a month before the 2007-2008 post election violence that saw the garbage-ridden roads and footpaths of Kaptembwa lined with mutilated bodies, death and destruction leaving widows, orphaned children and thousands homeless with no future and hope._x000D_

I graduated in 2008 from Africa Nazarene University where I was the first female student president and got a job at Imperial bank. However, I felt that I needed to work with the less fortunate in the society and thatâ€™s why I quit my job and co-founded our initiative that deals with the garbage that used to encroach my home. I was driven to create a sustainable source of livelihood to the less educated and marginalized women and youths in slums in Kenya.
