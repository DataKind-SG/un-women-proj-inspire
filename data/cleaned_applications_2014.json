For women to live proactively as working members of a society as well as take on the responsibility of raising happy and healthy children, it is crucial that the society accommodate for their need to be workers and mothers at the same time. _x000D_\nThe sian co,.ltd is a working platform for such young mothers who need flexible working conditions and have the initiative to make positive impact with the skill base they have acquired. Working at home, mostly online while keeping in close touch with the latest trends and insights in the education field, we provide solutions to schools and communities with limited resources and manpower to create much needed contents through R&D and consulting. In the 3 years we have worked, we have experimented with different ways to cater for the two rabbits in our lives and have proven stories to show that it is possible. We have also discovered how this continued identity and positioning in society lifts the huge burden on children to live as a measure of their mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need for acknowledgement. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWith the help of Project Inspire, we plan to take our experiment into a social movement. We have had numerous requests from mothers and companies wanting to uncover an alternative way to work for each other. With the experiences we have gathered as a working group, we have pinpointed three areas that need to be developed in order to influence and persuade the two groups (mothers and companies) to take appropriate action. _x000D_\nFirstly, the young mothers need a collective time for healing and rediscovery. Participants of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo Rabbits workshop\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be young full-time mothers and working mothers who want to rebuild a career path. Through the workshop, we will be focusing on three things;_x000D_\n1. Re-finding \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an objective overview of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity as an individual, mother, and a citizen._x000D_\n2. Re-positioning \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a professional overview of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career path and newly developed skill set and changed value system through child-rearing experience, A detailed overview of the changes in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifestyle and outlook in career. _x000D_\n3. Re-building \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a combined analysis and plan to locate areas of societal need where one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skill and value can make a difference hence rebuilding one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity as a worker and also a mother. Getting participants ready to take on the challenge of searching for a place to take a step._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAfter the workshop the participants will be given an option to follow up on their new discovery through a tailored internship experience that matches their skill, values and needs. A list of companies who are willing to open up to a new way of working to these ready career makers will be individually selected and consulted with an opportunity for recruitment. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nA socially embedded issue that greatly influences the life-changing decisions young women make in life and thereby impacting on the lives of her direct family do need a fundamental solution on multiple layers of policy and systems. But for changes to take place, someone needs to take that adventurous step built on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own experience to try something different. Finding a creative way for young mothers to take on their professional self again while continuing to be genuine mothers may not seem like a quick fix solution to some of Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-fought struggle.

These women will assemble an average of 80 solar lamps per person per month, for a total of 24 000 lamps by December 2015 (of which the first 3000 will be directly subsidised). The lamps directly subsidised by NERD Society will provide better studying and education opportunities to 3000 students (50% girls, or 1500 girls), providing an extra 4.3 million study hours per year. It is expected that 90% of the recipients of these lamps will adopt them as a part of their daily life, and that the maintenance of these, combined with sales of new lamps, will provide 96 000 Rps (about 1960 US$), worth of employment per year per SHG member. It is also expected that, as the market for solar lamps expands, an additional 10-15 SHGs will join the programme over the next 3 years.\nAs we will have established a demand for solar lights in the target communities by the end of the grant period, income-generating opportunities will continue to grow for local women.

The project will thus lead to increased opportunities and women empowerment into the foreseeable future.We also expect to see increased studying opportunities and emphasis on education for the schoolchildren involved, leading to higher school success rates and human development in the targeted villages. In addition, the replacement of kerosene lamps with emission-less solar lamps will have longer-term impacts on respiratory and eye health in the communities.\nBy December 2015, the project will have improved living conditions for the 30 women initially involved in the production of the lamps. Through assembly in SHGs and distribution in the villages, 3000 subsidised lamps will have been sold, and the communities will have adopted solar study lamps as an integral part of their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school supplies, ensuring the SHGs with a steady demand for solar lamps and their maintenance. We expect each woman involved to benefit from 8000 Rps (160$) in extra revenue every month (100 per lamp), which represents a typical working wage. We will also have linked the women SHGs to the producers of the solar lamp parts, allowing the women to form their own business supply-chain relations and to continue developing their enterprises after the end of our direct intervention.In addition, through the replacement of kerosene lamps with solar lamps, the recipient families of the solar lamps will benefit from expenditure savings on fuel.\nThe project will accomplish the following results:1.

The co-working office concept that began in the US (Dunsby 2014) is a hybrid between retail and a traditional office in which the current need for business professional who always on-the-go and don't need a full time office space is catered (Manegre 2014). This year, 2014 is the best time to launch a co-working office to fulfill the increasing demand for this concept (Dunsby 2014). This business concept is normally operated on a membership basis with provision of suitable furnishings, internet services, phone line, Wi-Fi and extension of service and equipment offerings for competitive advantage (Dunsby 2014). Bill Jacobson, CEO and Co-Founder of co-working space Workbar in Boston and Cambridge, mentioned that co-working spaces are the intersection of both a private space and a public space (Manegre 2014). Based on this concept, a new conceptual design, LIION's Lab is proposed._x000D_\nLIION's Lab provides a supportive community for working women who want a space closer to their kids to work, get fit and to connect and collaborate with peers. The main LIION's Lab business model is through membership. Members will enjoy the cosy but fun atmosphere with perks that include; (1) open workspace and lounge area with internet and utilities for collaboration and for organizing events, (2) kitchen and pantry to cook, create new recipe and entertain guest, (3) gym for maintaining health and fitness, (4) creche where babies and young children are cared for during the working day. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nLIION's Lab offer societal value and economic value where working mother can spend more time with the children, and be closer to them without compromising their work and network. In order to succeed and have sustainable profits over a period of time, there are multiple revenue opportunities available. This include selling (1) combine membership to have working space and child care space, (2) separate membership for women who want either working space or child care space, (3) membership for women who only need access to women-only gym, (4) hourly pass (5) daily pass and (6) non-member ticket for events. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe first facility will be started in Malaysia. This could be achieved by buying a 3-bedroom apartment that is located on top of retail premise and turn it into a co-working space, fitness space and child care space. USD $5,000 will be used for bank payment to pay deposit (including legal fees) to buy an apartment in a developing suburb that is located 78km away from Kuala Lumpur Central. USD$300 will be used to get business license, business registration with Companies Commission of Malaysia and to build and maintain company website with domain name for 1 year. USD $1,000 will be used for trademark protection. USD$700 will be used to pay high speed internet installation and for 1 year internet bills. USD$200 will be used for advertising. Refurbishment for whole apartments will need USD $4,000. Fitness equipment and furnishings will require USD $5,000. Accounting and legal service will require USD $2,000. Casual fitness instructor salary payment will require USD $2,000. Business training salary payment will require USD $3,800. USD $3,500 will be used for salary payment for management and administration duties. USD $1,500 will be used for salary payment for casual babysitter. These are just the rough estimation of the initial budget._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe reasons of choosing this apartment in this location are (1) closer to my family where I could get business advice along with emotional and financial support, (2) there is no existing business nearby that provide either a women-only gym or a co-working space (3) located 3km away from The Sultan Idris Education University, a public university where there are currently have 3235 female undergraduate, 32 female international student, 1,093 female post-graduate students, 266 female academic staff, 348 female non-academic staff and 6 female international staff (UPSI 2014) that contribute to the main 4,980 target market (4) 5km away from the main Tanjung Malim town that has always been known as the Education Town (5) the presence of other various education institutions that include preschools, primary schools, secondary schools, Private Higher Education Institutes, Public Higher Education Institute and Education Institute specific to civil servants, and (6) the existing economic activities and industrial planning such as the automobile by the construction of the national car factory, Proton in Bandar Proton (Proton Town), agricultural, manufacturing and the development of new housing projects, recreational facilities and others (Tanjong Malim District Council 2014)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAs a practical matter, it is likely that this concept will be initially rolled out in Tanjung Malim region before expanding to Kuala Lumpur City. The potential market for this project in Malaysia consists of three segments. The primary market is made up of 1,122,000  women entrepreneurs who participate in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (Teoh and Chong 2008). A secondary market includes approximately 6 million working or professional women, who may need a flexible working arrangement or childcare service. All 0.84 million of women in Kuala Lumpur (Department of Statistics Malaysia 2013) especially the young ones who are interested with fitness make up the final market segment. At this stage, it is difficult to accurately determine the likely usage of LIION's Lab, as utilization will be greatly dependent on location and the services provided. However, a total potential demand for this kind of space is estimated to be from 5,300 to 3,350 women entrepreneurs and small businesses just in the targeted sectors in the Kuala Lumpur area.  _x000D_\n  _x000D_\nOver the decade, Malaysian women participation in labour market has risen. Moreover, more and more women in this generation are taking the initiative to start their own business ventures and getting involved in the creation of new industries (Hoe et al. 2012). Over 7,000 Malaysian freelancers are found on global freelancers recruitment company, Elance (https://www.elance.com) and most of them are women. LIION's Lab facility will be helpful for these women freelancers to solve their isolation problem while working at home and letting them escape the distractions at home. The growing of small online business among Malaysian women with majority of them doing their business from home would be very advantageous for this project. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn addition to that, this concept is applicable to other women and girls across Africa, Middle-East and Asia Pacific._x000D_\n", "project_details": "Malaysia's major challenge after successfully eliminated most gender gaps in education is to increase women's opportunities to bring their talents to labor markets (World Bank 2012). A big increase in Malaysia's output per capital could be realized if more women participated in the labor market or became entrepreneurs, which adds to the managerial talent pool in the economy. The fifth Malaysia decennial census demonstrated that the percentage of employed females had increased from 33.5% (2000) to 37.7% (2010). However, working women in Malaysia faced two big problems; (1) the lifetime choice between work and family formation that attribute to low earning and (2) lack of technical and managerial skills invested for women as they are expected to leave their job while they are raising young children or, in many cases, to stop all work once they are married. Therefore, LIION's Lab will be implemented to help women to contribute in the economy without compromising their family values.

It is through this form of lasting empowerment that the project will show its commitment to impacting communities by simply giving women opportunity to be of influence to the people they are surrounded by. It is expected that more women will be in a position to take their children to school and be able to buy school supplies for their children. This project seeks to inspire the young women to use the business skills and tailoring skills they acquire to start small scale tailoring enterprises with the help of a mentoring program for small scale start-ups. _x000D_\n\nBefore the women begin training, there will be a clear understanding of their socio-economic positions on a case by case basis. We will, by making this a priority, understand each young woman's greatest needs. Since the aim is to provide an opportunity for a sustainable source of income, the revenue gained through this project, based on a comprehensive business plan and the execution thereof, will then allow the women to be in a position to improve their living standards from the monthly revenue made through this project. Their socio-economic standing will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and compared to their prior living conditions.

A child will be safeguarded from their perpetrator(s) should the perpetrator(s) be living in the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home.

Once the child feels a sense of safety, they will be able to speak about the abuse. Symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are often shown in a child when a child starts their therapy process. To prevent these symptoms from developing into a disorder, the child needs to be in a supportive environment. This is done in conjunction with the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents. Parents will be educated on how to provide a security safe environment for their child at home. Often the attachment with the parents has been damaged by the trauma experienced by the child. The child is constantly on the lookout for danger, they struggle with everyday things such as going to school in fear of getting into trouble. Small things will rattle them as they are continuously hyper vigilant. For a child, the world is experienced as a dangerous place, the goal is to change the pathways in the brain to help the child experience the world as a safe place again._x000D_\nPATCH therapists will teach the child the skills needed to deal with difficult, daily events in life and help them to repair their trust in relationships. This is accomplished when it is seen that a child starts to handle things with ease, their startle response to things becomes less, they find it easier to make friends and interact with their parents, and they become more happy and carefree.\nGood measurement tools are in place to evaluate the trauma symptoms shown in each child during the assessment period and the therapy process. These symptoms are evaluated to see if there has been a shift in symptoms of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) displayed when the child was first referred to PATCH. _x000D_\nThese symptoms are measured by the qualified professionals employed by PATCH as they are able to determine the rate at which a child responds to therapy and the positive responses of the child as a result of the therapy process, thereby gaining the strength needed to progress to the next positive level. _x000D_\n There are however, lots of society and community factors that PATCH has no control over. PATCH provides each child with the tools needed to deal with daily obstacles, but the environment will not always support them i.e. if the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family live in poverty or if the mother of the child supports the alleged perpetrator. _x000D_\nPATCH never closes a door on a child client and occasionally a child who has been treated by PATCH will come back for therapy during different stages of their adolescence to instil the support and love that PATCH has shown them.

Through these cooperatives, honey women will benefit from upfront buying of their honey to enable them meet their needs like school fees for children, improved seeds for farms and basic household needs that cannot wait till honey harvesting is done. Cooperative members will also benefit from honey produced interest. The importance of honey as medicine will be thought to the women. The importance of bees in crop pollination for increase in crop yields and promotion of biodiversity will also be taught to women. The aim of all this will be to reduce bush fires and the cutting of gallery forest for firewood by women. Each cooperative will benefit from material and equipment used in bee farming and these materials and equipment will be the cooperative property that will be open to use by members. Beehives will be placed on valleys and peripheries of their farms. CAMGEW will also organize agroforestry training workshops for women during which women learned agroforestry techniques. This agroforestry techniques taught will help peasant women farmer improve soil fertility, serve as wind breaks, provide flowers for bees to produce honey, increase source of income and provide fuel wood. Women and children move long distances to fetch firewood. Agroforestry tree species like Leuceana, Acacia, Tephrosia, Calliandra and Prunus africana will be planted in women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farms through field-based trainings. Considering the importance of agroforestry as climate change adaptation and being aware of the pressure on the finite amount of land available for agriculture, CAMGEW through this project will give peasant women the opportunity to learn and communicate the importance of protecting their soils using agroforestry practices through exchange visits among women farms. CAMGEW hopes to use a participatory approach in training workshops to facilitate exchange and sharing of knowledge, experience and skills on agroforestry techniques that can help these women practice conservation agriculture. Women need opportunities to share indigenous knowledge on best local agroforestry practices. Hunger, poverty, rural livelihoods, nutrition and human health are critical issues linked to climate change faced by Noni that need to be addressed in ways that are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. Food production in farms has reduced over the years. Existing farmlands have become less fertile with soil erosion by wind and rain dominant. Slash-and-burn has reduced soil fertility too. Soil is the basis of survival for the present and future generation but if it remains bare human reliance on it will be doubted. Agroforestry practices promote true soil conservation that leads to soil carbon management. CAMGEW through this project will help peasant women farmers in Noni use agroforestry techniques to properly manage carbon in agricultural ecosystems that will lead to less erosion, healthy soil, natural fertility, high productivity and increase biodiversity through radio programmes. Poor soil management is part climate change problem and good soil management is an integral part of the solution. Peasant women need to increase their ability to adapt to climate change through soil fertility management to increase food production. There is need for CAMGEW to promote agroforestry practices that will give peasant women farmers the opportunity to increase food production and conserve the soil while getting other benefits. Storing carbon in soil through agroforestry reduces atmospheric level of carbon. This will be done through radio programmes and community sensitization. The form cooperatives could also be used to market farm inputs and outputs where women are best organized. Bi-monthly radio programs through the Oku Community Radio will sensitize women on the importance of agroforestry techniques in conservation agriculture and bee farming on improving women livelihoods, the disadvantages of bushfires both to farmers and bee farming and the importance of women getting involved in bee farming will also be discussed.

The lives of marginalized, abandoned vulnerable peasant women will improve through apiculture and agroforestry. Honey produced will be sold and income generated used to improve women lives. Problems associated with soil degradation will be solved using agroforestry techniques. These techniques will improve on crop yields. Hunger will reduce with increased income and yields from farms and bee farming. The availability of wood from agroforestry trees will also reduce deforestation by community members for firewood and reduce women and children suffering of moving long distances to fetch firewood. Gallery forests and patches of the montane forest close to their residence will be protected. Women will be economically empowered through this project.

From January 2013 when we launched our operations till present, we have received over 60 teen mothers and 15 young women up to 35 years old for counselling. Out of this group 18 selected girls, are being sponsored in various rehabilitation programs. The 18 girls so far are into the following: 5 into small businesses, 5 special trade apprentices, 5 resuming & completing secondary education and three into vocational training. Our target group is teen mothers with a ceiling age of 22 years (to help give us an impact focus). The project forms a chain from previous year to another because some of the trainings take longer. This Projects Inspire program is really timely and would help us assist over 100 more girls in various programs, as we are currently limited by our means. Should we receive the funding, we will expand our area of focus. We reinsert the younger teen mothers (below 17 years) who dropped out of school in the standard educative system and sponsor them up to a level where they can learn a trade and be self-sufficient. They will receive on-going counselling sessions during their reorientation programs, while older women who do not qualify for our rehabilitation programs, will nonetheless benefit from individual counseling and orientation sessions. The teen mothers we sponsor will be of the following categories and rehabilitation programs: -with minimal education, (primary level and up to form 2) to learn a trade through apprenticeship and help them establish their own business; we will give stipend to the more matured and better educated ones (form IV and above) to pursue studies in higher level of vocational and technical institutions; for those who cannot count on the support of family members to help them with their children, we will give them loans to start or enhance their business after giving them basic classes in business management; we will expand our present orientation to capacity building of girls and women in selected villages to reduce the rate of illiteracy, and give them the possibility to learn trades so that they too can contribute to the economic development of their communities.", "project_details": "-Reinserting young mothers who dropped out of school due to child bearing, imposed illiteracy caused by this, coupled with the long-term frustration are reduced.-Families are relieved from the extra burden of having to meet the needs of their daughters and her child(ren), due to their state of inertia caused by the shock of lost dreams, which very often lead to having more children as a single mother.

You teach a man, you still teach a man_x000D_\nSHOMZ is a social enterprise established to bridge the gaps between the normal and disabled / disadvantaged people (women) via pedagogical and innovative approaches, hence creating social equity and a better lifestyle. SHOMZ sells products produced by the disabled women online and the profit earned is to provide an income of the producer and re-employ another woman to produce another product and the cycle goes. SHOMZ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to ensure its customers live healthy, so it promotes health education by messages delivered along with the product.

Employment is made easy where no interviews nor applications are needed by the employees except their skills in production. This helps increase the income of the person and motivates them work more, produce more and earn more. You buy one, you employ one. People can simply embark a change with a click of a button. People simply help a life of a person with each product they buy. SHOMZ also grows to offer social solutions in education by improving conditions in some places and help enrolling others into schools. It also provides health care solutions by offering medical interventions and purchasing implants and prosthetic limbs by mass selling of products.

The program is the co-creation of the Global Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Project (GWP) and its partner organisation, the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foundation Nepal (WFN), in collaboration with technical experts from both Australia and Nepal. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe program has been designed to respond to an identified skills gap in the local Nepalese economy. The program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targeted yet holistic approach increases the chances of women finding work and adds value to the local community and economy. In addition, the program challenges traditional gender stereotypes by supporting women to participate in a vocation that has historically been the domain of men. By equipping women with skills outside traditionally assigned gender roles, and through the integration of a community engagement component that supports critical thinking on gender, this program promotes behaviour and attitudinal shifts in the broader community and creates the necessary conditions for sustainable positive change towards gender equality. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nLight the Spark has two distinct yet interrelated phases: a technical course component, and a livelihood pathways component which supports women to enter the workforce. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe first phase entails the delivery of a six-week training program for women incorporating both practical classroom work and on-the-job training. The course teaches participants to work with low current (up to 50A) and low voltage electricity (up to 2230V) as well as electronic assembly work. It includes modules on soft skills training (personal presentation, customer service, leadership, critical thinking), workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights, electrical safety awareness and basic business management._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis component of the program was designed by Dr. Peter Freere, Senior Energy Advisor with World Vision Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Program Research and Advisory Team and board member of the Kathmandu Alternative Power and Energy Group (KAPEG), in collaboration with a local Nepalese expert, Muniraj Udaphyaya. Following a successful crowd-funding campaign, the first phase of Light the Spark was successfully piloted in January/February this year. Twelve socioeconomically disadvantaged Nepalese women who were selected by WFN participated in the course. The first phase was delivered on budget for AUS$6500, including initial program research and development costs. In the future, we believe this component of the course could be delivered at a significantly reduced cost per cohort thanks to identified cost savings and implementation improvements._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFollowing completion of the first phase, GWP (in collaboration with WFN, Dr Peter Freere and course trainer Muniraj Udaphyaya), conducted one- and three-month evaluations. These evaluations found the program to be successful on a number of key subjective and objective empowerment indicators, such as an increase in participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 self-confidence and their successful uptake of a highly applicable skillset. However, the evaluation also identified a number of important barriers that exist to women finding work in this field in Nepal, despite them now being equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge.

This project addresses these misconceptions, especially among the young girls by proving that agricultural ventures have income generation and wealth creation opportunities; that farming can also be a successful business venture and that there are various disciplines aligned to agriculture and not limited to just subsistence crop production. The young women who participate in the program will be empowered through education on productive living. There will be sustainable development in the community attained through the establishment of income-generating projects. The community will also benefit from sustainable development models which include access to finance through microfinance opportunities and internal savings and lending schemes.\nThe basic agriculture course will have a strong focus (60%) on practical project assignments carried out under supervision by experienced teaching staff. For those, market linkages with some private sector entities are already established which shall be expanded. Young Farmer Clubs will be established and extension services set up. The Agricultural Technical Education Programs will be synchronised to the season (crops) livestock production cycles and markets. They will comprise basic training on universal agricultural principles followed by specialisation which is exchangeable according to regions, and markets. When the programme participants return to practice, assessment on productivity and support will continue. The key to the success of this approach is on leveraging on strategic partnerships and market linkages with the private sector which will ensure that support and technical advice continues throughout the production cycle. \nGirls are the most powerful force for change in the world.

The evaluations will specifically assess best practices and methods for a national roll out and will form the basis for the development of a roll-out plan. Success will be evidenced through the number of successful agricultural enterprises set up by the girls on the program. Success will also be evidenced through the viability of the revolving fund and the internal savings and lending schemes. As more and more young girls are trained on entrepreneurship and financial literacy, they will get access to small funds to enable them to set up their ventures. Their ability to repay into the revolving fund is key to the success of the project. Household standards of living are also expected to improve through better nutrition, access to healthcare and access to education. Several social ills are also expected to decrease.

It is the primary project of Apne Aap Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Collective (AAWC)._x000D_\nABOUT AAWC: Founded in 1998, Apne Aap Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Collective is an anti-trafficking organization that serves the women and children of Kamathipura, the red light area of Mumbai that is also one of the largest and oldest red light areas in Asia. We operate three programs: (1) Umeed (\u00e2\u0080\u009chope\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for women in brothel-based prostitution (ages 18+), (2) Udaan (\u00e2\u0080\u009cflight\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for daughters of Umeed women (ages 6-18), and (3) Umang (\u00e2\u0080\u009cjoy\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for toddlers of Umeed women (ages 2-5).

Since 1998, we have served more than 2,800 women and children._x000D_\n_x000D_\nABOUT UDAAN: Udaan is unique because we empower these girls to develop a passion for education and confidence in their individual talents and abilities, despite the socio-cultural messages that they are valuable only for sex, child-bearing and housekeeping. Moreover, unlike many other NGOs in this sector, we encourage aspirational professions and genuine socioeconomic mobility, not just vocational training in menial skills and low-wage positions. Once they are empowered to make voluntary and autonomous decisions, and become financially self-reliant, they can also help their mothers exit the vicious cycle of violence, exploitation and debt bondage from their pimps or brothel owners, and relocate to places away from the red-light area._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIMPACT: Since 1998, 100% of Udaan graduates have found mainstream professions outside of prostitution, and 97%+ pass their board exams.

The other underlying impact of this project is to bring rural community women together in an environment where they feel empowered.Local community women who are currently working as health worker, will be the SHG members.Being socially acceptable & highly regarded in the community, they will be the educator, marketer and distributor to the local women.The SHG members will be earning a decent income, running a business and satisfying a basic yet very private need of all womenfolk and will be seen as role-models. We envision that, the success of this women-led SHGs will encourage other rural communities to adopt this model.\nIn conjunction with local community,we are providing Maternal & Child HealthCare(MRCH). We have achieved 95% ANC coverage (National avg 19.6%) & 100% institutional delivery in this area.Our physicians & women health workers are educating women about importance of safe,sanitary menstrual practice including usage of sanitary napkins.

We will establish two SHGs & corresponding manufacturing unit in two Gram Panchayet/Community catering to approx 5000 women in each community(refer Population.xls file). For each pilot sites the two short term impacts are: A.Increase use of Sanitary Napkins.Goal is to achieve 50% usage by 1st year & 95% usage by 2nd year. B.Making the Self-Help Group(SHG) self-sustained by 1st year & generate enough profit by 3rd year, which will be used as capital to open up another SHG run unit in a nearby community.\nWe are committed to achieve the following two results: 1. Raising awareness of reproductive hygiene & increase use of sanitary napkins among the community women.Goal is to achieve 50% usage by 1st year & 95% usage by 2nd year.Quantitative &qualitative health surveys in Maternity Healthcare camps and door to door survey will be the mechanism of evaluating this success. 2.

The profit will augment the initial seed funding required to do all the setup of a new SHG and manufacturing unit.\nOur project evaluation is a rigorous,scientific process following either of the options. 1)The population is divided into 2 arms:The intervention arm & Control arm (intervention not applied). 2)Compare before intervention(baseline) & after intervention (follow-up) data among whole population. The 2nd option is currently being followed. For accurate collection of baseline data, Field Assessment, Qualitative Surveys(Focus Group Discussions & In Depth Interviews) and finally Quantitative survey based on properly designed questionnaire has been conducted. During & after the Intervention the same questionnaire(slightly expanded) will be used for follow up data collection for final evaluation.Evaluation is a continuous process in our project, starting from the onset of the project and continuing during implementation & operations. We have already obtained baseline data regarding current usage of napkins & related disease burdens.During implementation,among local community women, appropriate questionnaire based health surveys will be conducted before and after intervention to evaluate the change in awareness in reproductive hygiene. The primary success criteria, usage of sanitary napkins compared to the baseline data will be collected as follow-up data during the last three months of operation phase.The reduction of RTIs & other diseases will be collected over time as part of our \u00e2\u0080\u009cArogyaMaternalCare' health program to evaluate the reduction in the associated disease burdens. \nThe seed of our organization was planted in Rahimpur Village in India in 2009, when a group of young medical students & public health researchers got together to bring quality Maternal & Child Healthcare.Realizing potential of technology, the physicians started to collaborate with few engineering students & professionals for better delivery of Healthcare in rural India. In this site 'ArogyaMaternalCare' project was started initially funded by few social entrepreneurs and by volunteer support. The need of this project, low-cost sanitary napkin, was identified in the 'ArogyaMaternalCare' project and for the initial capital investment we applied for few projects.

Women resort to unhygienic alternatives like old cloth rags, husks, sand, or even ashes which results in vaginal infections often leading to chronic Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs), pelvic inflammatory diseases, Child-Birth issues and sometimes life-threatening cervical cancerm the most prevalent form of cancer among woman in India.A countrywide survey conducted AC Nielsen and Plan India, among women and adolescent girls all throughout India revealed that nearly 70 percent of women said that their families cannot afford sanitary napkins and that over 88 percent of women resorted to shocking alternatives such as cloth, ashes and husk sand during menstruation, thereby causing severe reproductive health problems. The study showed that Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) was 70% more common among women using unhygienic practices while 12% of women who use napkins are at a lower risk of cervical cancer which is the most prevalent form of cancer among women in developing nations. The primary reason cited for this problem in rural India is unaffordability and high cost of sanitary napkins whose average price range is approximately Rs. 60/- to as high as Rs 100/- for a pack of 8. As the sanitary napkin products are not available in a single pack, the rural women, who are mostly daily wage earner at Rs 120/day, needs to shell out \u00c2\u00bd of her wage to buy a single pack of Sanitary napkin. The cheapest sanitary napkin available at Rs 30/- for a pack of 8, is also not cheap enough, if we take into consideration the large Below Poverty Line(BPL) population ( The threshold of BPL population in rural India is Rs 32/- day). Also, the cheap napkins are so poor in quality that instead of one, multiple napkins (at-least two) are required in a day, thus effectively costing twice as much or Rs. 60/- (Rs 30 X 2) for the whole period_x000D_\nStill, a large population of rural women, who could have afford the sanitary napkins, do not use them for the following two reasons:_x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Low awareness of proper reproductive hygienic practices. This is probably the biggest barrier for adoption, as reproductive hygiene education and sexual education is not part of any education system in India. The adolescent girls only form of such education is from her mother and grandmother, who themselves had practiced the unhygienic behaviors for years and thus do not see any harm in the practices of using old cloths during menstruation. Though in urban India the trend has changed in recent years, but in rural India, these topics remained significantly taboo among all, irrespective of social and economic status. _x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Poor Accessibility and Social barrier. Sanitary Napkins are only available in the Pharmacies generally located in the largest village in that area. Without proper metallic road and public transportation, it is very difficult to reach the pharmacy. On top of that, social issues prevent women from obtaining sanitary napkins at local pharmacies due to embarrassment on the topic. As all pharmacies are run by men, women feel socially uncomfortable asking for these products from male pharmacists._x000D_\nTo solve these three hurdles, we are enabling local women, currently working as women health worker, to form Self-Help Groups (SHG) to produce low-cost, yet high quality Sanitary Napkins which will be distributed by them (as Direct Sales Channels) to the local community women, as part of the existing door-to-door to maternal health services program. _x000D_\nWe are changing definition of Self-Help Group(SHG). While traditional SHGs are generally, micro-finance groups, our SHGs will produce tangible products, whose need has been organically identified (Instead of market survey,the product/need was organically identified from the Reproductive Health programs of our team which also created awareness of using napkin), and revenue,similar to a manufacturing startup. The women SHG members working with local women will create an environment of women empowerment not only in the immediate communities, but also will create a ripple effect of women empowerment by means of producing something very close, personal and important for a women's life cycle, in nearby and fur-flung rural communities of India._x000D_\nThe high-level plan and activities of executing the project is:_x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The SHG members will act as the educators of safe & sanitary feminine hygiene practices among local women and the necessity of sanitary napkins. Currently this activity is being executed by the local physicians and the members._x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The SHG members will be trained in inexpensive, low-maintenance manufacturing equipment ($2500 machine compared to high-cost machine of $500,000) producing 50% cheaper sanitary napkins compared to what is available in the market, which will still be profitable thus self-sustaining the SHG within a year.. This machine has already been invented by an Indian social entrepreneur, ArunachalamMuruganantham, and is capable of producing 1000 high-quality sanitary napkins per day at a total cost of Rs 1 (including all overhead) which is significantly more affordable than any other sanitary napkin on the market (Rs. 3.50/-). As such, for a pack of 8, these sanitary napkins can be sold at Rs. 15 earning profit and still will be 50% less compared to the cheapest, low quality sanitary napkins available in the market. Also, unlike the current sanitary napkins which are only available in packs of 7 or 8, we will sell the sanitary napkins individually at Rs.1.50 to Rs. 2. This price point will make it more affordable to the daily wage earner rural women._x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The SHG members will be trained in end to end business process, such as marketing, sales, distribution and finance. _x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The SHG members will create a direct distribution/sales channel to the local community women as part of the existing door-to-door to maternal health services program . _x000D_\nThe SHGs are also deploying unique distribution channels to increase usage & sales of sanitary napkins_x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Unlike the current sanitary napkins which are only available in packs of 7 or 8, the SHG will sell the sanitary napkins individually at Rs.1.50 to Rs. 2. This will be achieved by deploying Vending Machines at strategic and convenient locations (schools, colleges, community halls) where the women can securely and privately obtain individual sanitary napkins by dropping a coin of Rs. 2/- only._x000D_\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Finally, create a multi-prong distribution channel for taking it to the all women in the rural area, such as, recommending it through local physicians, government community health workers (ASHA workers) as well as convincing the local government health officials to provide it through the public primary health centers, government hospitals and village offices and community centers (such as Panchayet office, Clubs)_x000D_\nWe have identified our pilot site for this project in a rural community in West Bengal, India where we have experienced similar unhygienic practices during conducting Maternal and Child healthcare services. Currently, a few women volunteer health workers are providing door-to-door Maternal and Child Health Care in this site, [which is in Jangipara Community block in West Bengal, India consisting of following Gram Panchayats (Villages): Antpur, Dilakash, Furfurah, Jangipara, Kotalpur, Mundalika, Radhanagore, Rajbalhat I, Rajbalhat II and Rahimpur].

We started our business in 2010 with 4 employees. Four years later our impact has greatly increased - we now have 35 full-time employees and up to 20 part-time employees in Ghana. Our employees have access to a number of trainings including literacy classes, financial education, health and business among others. In order to further expand the reach of our company, we would like to build a community space so that we can open our classes to the public and create a batik apprenticeship program. _x000D_\nBuilding a Community Classroom and Batik Center will allow us to grow our impact. After four years of working in partnership with our employees in Ghana, we have learned how to empower them to make positive changes in their lives. We have worked with them to improve spending habits and save money. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned the best way to bring a local expert in to do workshops with our employees.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always wanted to open these programs to other women within the community that we work, but we have never had the space. As it is, our current classes are held outside and are often cancelled if the weather is bad (which it is, six months of the year). By building a Community Classroom, we will be able to offer stronger, better programming and open this resource up to the community. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWithin the last year, we as a company have started to experiment with batik making. This is a style of textile dyeing in Ghana that uses wax and different color dyes to create beautiful prints on fabric. Though popular in Ghana, there are very few trained batik artists in the community in which we work. We would like to open a Batik Center alongside our community classroom so that we may create additional jobs and apprenticeship opportunities in the region. In January, we secured a partnership with Vans in which we produced batik fabric for a line of shoes. If we are able to create this Batik Center and train more women in the art of wax printing, we will be able to bring additional revenue to the region through similar partnerships in the future. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nUnemployment and underemployment are tremendous problems for women in Ghana.

They found that their income was inconsistent - some weeks they would do very well and earn enough money to provide for their families, but often, monthly income did not cover living expenses. This means seamstresses would forgo meals or have to withdraw their children from school until they earned enough to pay the fees.

In a country with high unemployment and countless barriers to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equality, RV United works to empower young women through the dual-pronged approach of soccer and entrepreneurship. In early 2012, RVU formed when a group of adolescent girls ages 13-24 who had participated in Grassroot Soccer (GRS), a nonprofit that uses soccer as a tool to educate about HIV & AIDS, found they enjoyed playing soccer during the program. The girls wanted the opportunity to continue playing despite the widely held local belief that girls cannot, and should not, play soccer. Khayelitsha\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is home to an estimated half a million people\u00e2\u0080\u0094did not have a single girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 soccer team, so the girls took the initiative to approach GRS staff with a proposal to form their own squad. Initially the players were hesitant to play publicly because boys would ridicule and tease them. However, after 6 months of public trainings and participation in local tournaments, attitudes began to visibly shift. Boys became true fans and supporters of the team, traveling to games and tracking players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 statistics. _x000D_\nBy June 2012, the powerful impact of RV United in the community became vividly apparent. A group of girls ages 8-13 approached RVU and lobbied to form a team for younger players, RV Juniors. Meanwhile, girls from neighboring areas started contacting RVU coaches, pleading for transport money so they could travel 45 minutes every day to play. Within RVU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first year, the club had expanded to three full-sized teams with 60 girls spanning two age divisions. The rapid growth of RVU emerged in response to the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 desire to belong to a team and play soccer, challenging gender norms and emerging more empowered and confident young women._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWhile girls were eager to join RVU, paying for league fees, transport, and equipment was a constant challenge, as most players resided in households with an average annual income of R21,000 [~USD$1,980]. To address the issue, in 2013 RV United approached Ragball International (RBI) for a pilot project that uses soccer to develop financial empowerment. RBI is an income generation project in which youth produce handmade soccer balls from recycled materials in exchange for a fair wage and financial education. Ragballs are used in many parts of the country where young people are unable to access or afford real soccer balls. Together, the two organizations piloted an economic empowerment model that encourages players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 entrepreneurial spirit and includes the creation of ragballs, a small income, workforce skills, and a workshop on financial education and business literacy._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDuring the pilot RVU players created 100 handmade ragballs, which sold online to international buyers. The girls agreed to split their portion of the proceeds: half went to the individual players as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwages\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the other half went towards the team budget for transport, equipment, and league fees. Their decision to work as a team to support RVU helped reinforce the lessons of earning money to support something about which they care deeply. Alongside the creation of the ragballs, the team participated in innovative soccer-based financial education and entrepreneurial training workshops and learned about saving, spending, and how to plan for their futures. Based on the Aflatoun Social & Financial Education curriculum, the Ragball experience has allowed the girls access to new platforms to learn and share ideas about financial awareness among youth, including participation in the Child & Youth Finance International\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Global Money Week._x000D_\n_x000D_\nRV United will use the USD$25,000 to elevate the partnership with RBI to a more comprehensive full-year program. The ragball workshops will continue throughout 2015, using a newly developed 17-session curriculum. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe money will be used to achieve three objectives. First, building off their early success selling the ragballs internationally, the team will identify and exploit local markets, setting up formal stalls in tourist markets and booths at events and soccer tournaments throughout Cape Town. This will raise local awareness about the changing status of soccer as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cboys-only\u00e2\u0080\u009d sport in Khayelitsha while providing a new type of work experience for the players, who will work as salespeople at the stalls. Thus, they will have the opportunity to experience each step of the retail process: product development, manufacturing, and sales. As salespeople, they will share the inspiring story of RVU while selling products they created with their own hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094products they are truly proud of. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSecond, the RVU players will lead a re-design of the Ragball product, a chance to hone their skills in creative and innovative product design. The new balls will be more complex than the originals and will sell at a higher price, earning a higher profit for the team. The launch of a new product line will help the players gain additional ownership of this entrepreneurial venture and provide an opportunity to be truly creative. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThird, this year-long program offers RBI the opportunity to refine and improve upon its model for use in RVU and other youth groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 soccer teams\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Khayelitsha and the neighboring townships. During the workshop, the girls on the RVU Senior team will be trained as peer educators, gaining tools to spread their financial knowledge to other youth in the community. Money will go towards stipends and transport for these RV players to deliver the program to other youth groups and teams, and during HIV Testing & Counseling (HCT) soccer tournaments hosted by partner GRS. Based on the learnings from this year-long project, RBI will scale up its educational workshops by replicating the model to other GRS sites in Alexandra and Soweto, where community teams already exist. This expanded reach will provide a platform for individual economic empowerment to more youth across South Africa._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThus, the income generation partnership with RBI provides the means to continue playing soccer and challenge gender norms and an opportunity for meaningful, first-hand entrepreneurial experience and training in healthy money management.

It is the primary project of Apne Aap Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Collective (AAWC)._x000D_\nABOUT AAWC: Founded in 1998, Apne Aap Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Collective is an anti-trafficking organization that serves the women and children of Kamathipura, the red light area of Mumbai that is also one of the largest and oldest red light areas in Asia. We operate three programs: (1) Umeed (\u00e2\u0080\u009chope\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for women in brothel-based prostitution (ages 18+), (2) Udaan (\u00e2\u0080\u009cflight\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for daughters of Umeed women (ages 6-18), and (3) Umang (\u00e2\u0080\u009cjoy\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for toddlers of Umeed women (ages 2-5). Through these programs, we provide our members with the tools and resources to create a better quality of life. Since 1998, we have served more than 2,800 women and children._x000D_\n_x000D_\nABOUT UDAAN: Udaan is unique because we empower these girls to develop a passion for education and confidence in their individual talents and abilities, despite the socio-cultural messages that they are valuable only for sex, child-bearing and housekeeping. Moreover, unlike many other NGOs in this sector, we encourage aspirational professions and genuine socioeconomic mobility, not just vocational training in menial skills and low-wage positions. Once they are empowered to make voluntary and autonomous decisions, and become financially self-reliant, they can also help their mothers exit the vicious cycle of violence, exploitation and debt bondage from their pimps or brothel owners, and relocate to places away from the red-light area._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIMPACT: Since 1998, 100% of Udaan graduates have found mainstream professions outside of prostitution, and 97%+ pass their board exams. Our alumni have obtained Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degrees and launched successful careers in respected professions like accounting, beauty, business, dance, hospitality management, luxury cuisine, nursing, photography, retail, teaching, social work, etc._x000D_\n_x000D_\nACTIVITIES: Udaan provides services in seven focus areas: outreach, health, finance, education, empowerment, shelter, and recreation._x000D_\n_x000D_\n[1] Outreach: to facilitate constant exchange of information between Organization and community_x000D_\n- The field team establishes a strong foundation of camaraderie and trust with the women and girls by making daily visits into the brothels, streets, homes, schools, and hospitals of our beneficiaries.

As a testament to our strength, many other NGOs in the red light area source their beneficiaries indirectly through Udaan because they are unable to establish the same relationship with the girls and their mothers._x000D_\n- Udaan also encourages active participation of girls in their own development by conducting monthly meetings on important reports, workshops, and updates._x000D_\n_x000D_\n[2] Health: to maintain physical, mental, and sexual health_x000D_\n- Daily meals and supplements: customised by a dietician, based on ages and stages of development_x000D_\n- Hospital referrals, subsidized when required: e.g., for STIs, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, violence, malaria, etc._x000D_\n- HIV / AIDS care: anti-retroviral treatment and careful monitoring_x000D_\n- Workshops on hygiene, personal health, and reproductive health_x000D_\n- Psychological counselling: e.g., academic performance, higher education, career choices, puberty, family relationships, sexual abuse, substance abuse, violence, sexual health, etc._x000D_\n- Monthly physical checkups in line with World Health Organization standards for height, weight, and BMI_x000D_\n- Quarterly medical camps in collaboration with nearby hospitals: general/sexual health, dental health, vision, and malaria detection_x000D_\n_x000D_\n[3] Finance: to provide foundation for financial independence_x000D_\n- Assist girls with opening and maintaining savings accounts at Indian Post Office (up to 500 INR)_x000D_\n- Assist girls with opening accounts at Bank of Maharashtra (more than 500 INR)_x000D_\n- Workshops on financial literacy to instill a culture of saving that is largely absent in red light district_x000D_\n_x000D_\n[4] Education: to instill discipline and love of learning_x000D_\n- School registration: procure necessary documentation (e.g., birth certificate/affidavit) to gain admission to government, private, and boarding schools._x000D_\n- Daily afterschool tuitions in all subjects: tuitions for Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, and English medium students at all ages_x000D_\n- Weekly quizzes to verify progress of each girl between school exams_x000D_\n- Preparation for school exams: at least 1 girl scores at the top of her class every year_x000D_\n- Higher education: admissions to college (11th and 12th) and university (Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s)_x000D_\n- Distance learning: girls who must work full-time after 12th standard are enrolled into Open University programs_x000D_\n_x000D_\n[5] Empowerment: to develop self-esteem, discipline, talent, leadership_x000D_\n- Excursions/exposure visits: e.g., American Library (U.S. Consulate), Bombay High Court, Byculla Fire Brigade, Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum, Jahangir Art Gallery, Nair Hospital, Nagpada Police Station, Nehru Planetarium, Reserve Bank of India, Sir J.J.

Long term impact of the program includes: Empowering Women and girls/ Promoting Gender Equality and Social inclusion / Improvement of Economic condition and eradication of extreme poverty/ Possibilities for social mobility/ Improvement of physical and mental health condition of women / stronger sense of self and community \n- Improving Economic condition of families- Raising self confidence and sense of community_x000D_\n- Healing physical and mental damages through improved social skills_x000D_\n- Family planning Education will reduce the number new cases of sexually transmitted Illness_x000D_\n- Literacy classes, allow women to improve the quality of their daily lives. _x000D_\n- Supporting girls who struggle with their studies, reduces the possibility of dropping out of school and getting pulled into child labor \nThe main objective of the centre is to enhance and strengthen the women and girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability in dealing with the great problems they face in their social and family environment. This can be achieved by creating appropriate conditions for the development and growth of women and girls who are condemned to forced marriage, unwanted pregnancies, family violence and discrimination. Every step in this direction brings us closer to the Centre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective of enablement of women and girls. As a belief in hope and in their ability had to blossom in women and girls, and each had to begin the change in herself, educating them was an obvious starting point. Therefore, literacy, vocational and art classes were set up in the Centre. This helped them to see the relevance of education in their own vocation. A simple example: \u00e2\u0080\u009cusing a tape measure in tailoring is better than using spans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe most important development that has taken place in the Centre has been the empowerment of women and girls. Their belief in their knowledge and ability, and the advancement of their self confidence, has developed into a great and beautiful truth, the effect of which has been evident, not only in the women and girls themselves, but also in families and men in the community. Those who have gone through this Centre are now employed as skilled workers in sewing workshops. The Centre has become a place for learning to read and write for women and girls of the neighbourhood, women and girls who, despite heavy work and child care, and under unfavourable conditions, willingly participate in literacy classes. Transformation is clearly apparent in parenting skills of mothers who have just learned to read and write. The teaching of \u00e2\u0080\u009cparenting skills\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a new light in the lives of these women that helps them to improve their approach to their children. They have gradually learned to raise their children without using force and punishment. In a neighbourhood where addiction and other social are prevalent, lessons in life skills can be the best teaching for a girl who is faced with these social problems. A girl who lives with addicted parents can learn how to take care of herself, and how to free herself from the vicious cycle and the unhealthy environment that dominates her family relations. This in itself is a great task. Some even travel long distances to come to the Centre becaus\n45 Private funders provided the centre with steady annual support of USD $18000.The estimation is based on current exchange price of dollar.

Darvaze Ghar is considered to be the centre of drug dealership and drug distribution in Tehran. Material and cultural poverty, large and dense population, early marriages, high level of fertility, widespread level of addiction, low level of literacy, and absence of any vocational or educational centres for women and girls in the locality are some of the reasons behind our decision to establish AMDG in this neighbourhood. Providing training for girls and women is aimed at enabling them to rely on their own abilities, and play a greater part in provision of material needs of the family, but also to acquire skills necessary for facing problems at home and in the society. The ultimate aim is enabling them in a multi facetted process of work, education, and training._x000D_\nThe aim of the Centre is social and economic empowerment of local women and girls through education.

In this neibourhood, poverty forces many to resort to muggings, prostitution, and drug dealing. The AMDG centre provides vocational and social skills training as well as basic literacy to women and girls. A particularity of the teaching system at the Centre is the short distance between learning and production. Within a week after joining the Centre one learns to perform basic functions on the sewing machine. By sewing products (i.e. bed sheets) that requires only basic skills they become productive and gain a basic income. However, improving social skills, healthcare and family planning, and strengthening the community by encouraging the spirit of cooperation instead of competition, are all parts of the process of empowerment.

Warm Heart will continue to expand its cooperative structure to provide ongoing employment in the dry season for Phrao women. Warm Heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term goal is to encourage women to maintain their businesses year-round rather than suspend them to work in lower-skilled, physically demanding agricultural work. Accordingly, we would consider the project a strong success if in three years at least 10 women maintained the cooperative year-round rather than returning to agricultural work. This would be a distinct shift in employment trends in Phrao District and a significant advance in empowering female artisans. _x000D_\nTrade Monkey will have a permanent social impact staff that consistently assesses and undertakes development projects with all of its local partners. Three years out, Trade Monkey will be a leader in the social venture fiel\nIn the short-run, Trade Monkey and Warm Heart will support stable incomes for 10 women and their families in Phrao District. On average, each woman has a 5-person household in the dry season and often cares for her daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 children while they are away working. Consequently, the first year will directly influence 50 family-members at home and approximately 15 daughters away working. Indirectly, Project Inspire will strengthen the ongoing work of Warm Heart who annually impacts the lives of 80 women in its other cooperatives, 65 children in its home and at schools, and all their families. Supporting Phrao women with steady employment will have a multiplier effect that will positively impact at least 215 women and children in the community by January 2016. By creating a sustainable cooperative model we also hope to build trust in the local community towards building additional cooperatives in future.\nWe are committed to: providing stable incomes for 10 Phrao women and their families during the economically uncertain dry season; creating a sustainable cooperative structure for Phrao women and Warm Heart to continue in future years; designing, producing, marketing, and selling 2,000 handmade, upcycled products to generate seed money for Warm Heart and the Phrao cooperative; launching a targeted marketing plan across 8 college campuses and online to generate and fulfill demand for those products; developing a social impact team and consistent business-based development model at Trade Monkey for future development projects. _x000D_\nWe are purposefully launching our social impact program with a small group of 10 women in Phrao to build our model and ensure that we have a lasting impact beyond the initial group. Trade Monkey currently works with 20 distinct producers in Thailand and Cambodia and are vetting an additional 30. We aim to expand the number of producers we partner with to over 100 by December 2015 and ultimately implement our social impact program in all our producer communities.\nThe biggest indicators of success will be the return of all ten Phrao women to the cooperative in January 2016, the establishment of the cooperative as a financially independent business, and demonstrated interest among other women in joining the cooperative structure. _x000D_\nWe will also verify success based on increased demand for Trade Monkey products among our target college-campus market; we will measure this through tracking sales, return customers, and referrals. At the producer-level, we will monitor the ability of Phrao cooperatives to expand sustainably to meet that increased demand by tracking staffing levels, number of orders, quality, and turn-around time._x000D_\n _x000D_\nLong-term we will work with Warm Heart to monitor seasonal income and employment in Phrao District and at its cooperatives. Finally, Trade Monkey will consider its Project Inspire project successful if our team is able to replicate our business-based development model in other communities, always being sure to assess specific community needs to identify appropriate goals and projects.\nAs this project will become a part of Trade Monkey and Warm Heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing workload, the two organizations will necessarily contribute certain costs out of their own budgets._x000D_\nTrade Monkey will independently contribute grant management, support services, its own labor costs, and any transportation and marketing costs in excess of the Project Inspire budget._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWarm Heart will contribute the majority of Ms. Somjai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salary, labor costs for other staff involved in assisting with their microenterprise program, and some transportation costs. ", "project_name": "Social Impact at Trade Monkey", "sectors": "", "project_summary": "Trade Monkey is a social enterprise that connects consumers to trendy, unique, high-quality handmade products while actively promoting stable incomes in developing communities. Without targeted design, production, and marketing strategies, local artisans struggle to access the global marketplace and scale up their businesses. Such artisans are overwhelmingly women who provide the primary income for their families. Trade Monkey already closes the gap between female artisans and overseas consumers, but is poised to expand our socially responsible business practices into direct reinvestment into our producer communities. _x000D_\nProject Inspire presents an ideal opportunity for Trade Monkey to develop its social impact program via a much-needed development project with one of our local producers in Northern Thailand. In collaboration with our nonprofit partner Warm Heart, Trade Monkey will use the $25,000 grant to create stable jobs for women in rural Phrao District while building a sustainable and innovative model for future development projects._x000D_\n _x000D_\nIn operation since 2008, Warm Heart Worldwide, Inc. is an American nonprofit based in Phrao District, one of the poorest districts in Northern Thailand.

In Phrao, women work in rice planting and harvesting seven months of the year and can earn 120 baht ($4) per day. During the five months of the dry season, however, there is no agricultural work in Phrao, and able-bodied adults migrate to the South to find work. A core of middle aged women stay home to care for family members. These women are the Warm Heart Microenterprise Program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target population. They are already skilled artisans, but currently lack organizational structure, design experience, and marketing skills._x000D_\n _x000D_\nWith this grant, we will help these women create an effective organization and secure stable, dry season \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and eventually year around \u00e2\u0080\u0093 jobs. Specifically, we will provide capital equipment, working capital, business development training, design consulting, and global marketing._x000D_\n _x000D_\nWe will begin by purchasing high-quality, industrial sewing machines, glue guns, and grommet machines. This capital equipment will allow women to significantly increase production, improve quality, and diversify the products they make. Specifically, industrial machines allow artisans to work with thick materials such as rice bags, vinyl, and recycled seat belts to create \u00e2\u0080\u009cupcycled\u00e2\u0080\u009d products. By using discarded materials, such products are inexpensive to produce, unique pieces, and have low environmental impact.

Ms. Somjai will draw on Warm Heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong community connections to bring skilled artisans into a cohesive group. Ms. Somjai brings her previous experience as a designer, retail manager, pattern cutter, and sample sewer; through this project she will become a financial and business skills trainer. Her permanent place at Warm Heart and in the Phrao community will guarantee our project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing impact ($2,700 into manager subsidy)._x000D_\n _x000D_\nWe also anticipate engaging the Micro Economic Development Foundation, a Thai organization based in Chiang Mai, to provide business literacy training to the cooperative. Rather than dictating solutions to local women, the consultant will assess their needs and goals to form the cooperative that works best for them ($640 into training)._x000D_\n _x000D_\nIt is not enough to simply give women equipment and a business structure; a business requires working capital to purchase raw materials and pay artisans. We will use a portion of the grant to cover materials and pay fair wages based on Warm Heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing payment structure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 166% of current rainy season agricultural wages. Furthermore, we will subsidize Ms. Somjai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salary in recognition of her important role as Project Manager. Trade Monkey will independently contribute grant management, support services, its own labor costs, and some marketing costs ($11,466 into working capital)._x000D_\n _x000D_\nEffective marketing strategies are crucial for sustainable economic growth, but are often missing from development programs in marginalized communities. Trade Monkey will design a line of upcycled products for U.S. college students. We have targeted this demographic for its size, interest in social impact, and because of timing. By the end of the dry season (May 2015) the Phrao cooperative will have completed 2,000 items ready for the 2015 fall semester. Then, we will launch a specific marketing campaign targeting eight college campuses with which Trade Monkey has existing connections. Investing in marketing will be the key to continuing the project ($1,200 into distribution; $5,060 into marketing)._x000D_\n _x000D_\nThrough sales revenue, we aim to double the grant and reinvest the first year profits back into Warm Heart and the Phrao cooperative. After assessing lessons learned, Trade Monkey will expand its business-based development model to its other partner communities. As such, our Project Inspire proposal will exponentially impact more women in the long-term. _x000D_\n _x000D_\nTrade Monkey will launch its social impact program in 2015 regardless, specifically focusing on empowering women through sustainable business practices that provide market access, marketable designs, and organizational capacity.

We believe equipping women small farmers with the skills to improve production and manage changes is therefore an important step towards securing livelihoods and reducing poverty. _x000D_\nThe broader strategic goal of the project is to contribute to the reduction of rural poverty in Mpigi district through strengthened capacity of small women farmers to engage in marketable agricultural production and enhanced business knowledge._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSpecifically the project aims at:_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1. To assist 60 marginalized rural women farmers in developing to commercialized farming thus increasing agricultural production and eventually their income earning capacity. _x000D_\n2. To organize a group of 60 marginalized women farmers into a fully functioning women agricultural cooperative supported with knowledge to develop high-value agricultural products and strengthen links with profitable markets and service providers._x000D_\n_x000D_\n3. To train 60 marginalized women farmers in agricultural skills, financial literacy and business development. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n4.

Training in Agricultural Techniques and Financial Literacy_x000D_\nThe Project is community based, in that the participants themselves decide and design their training curricula and networking opportunities.

Basic numeracy is particularly useful for women in managing their agricultural and off-farm enterprises, more so when credit and savings are involved._x000D_\n_x000D_\n3. Set up a Demonstration Farm:_x000D_\nA fully equipped demonstration farm is to be set up as a point of practical training and perfection throughout the project period. The demonstration farm will act as a learning center to the farmers to showcase modern sustainable agricultural techniques. A mix of traditional and modern information and communication technology tools will augment other avenues to provide access to information to the women. _x000D_\nThe farm will be managed and operated by a farm committee chosen among the women who will seek and recruit employees on the farm as required. In the initial set up of the farm we shall rely on the beneficiary farmers and the youth as volunteers to do the necessary work with limited help from sourced labor. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n4. Exchange Visits and Study Tours_x000D_\nThis activity is aimed at facilitating farmers learning from their successive counterparts, discussing and sharing experiences and gain motivation. Beneficiaries will be exposed to visits to other prominent farmers in different areas and witness for themselves that what they learn is practicable. This enhances farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interaction and promotes farmer to farmer learning. _x000D_\nThe purpose of these tours is to educate the group by demonstrating other innovative and proven ways how local small farms manage risk in areas such as production, marketing and finance. On these tours members will learn about unique growing methods, farm management systems, crops, equipment, facilities, value-added products, marketing, sales and much more. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n5. Follow Ups and Evaluation_x000D_\nTrained farmers are offered post training services geared towards smooth transition to sustainable practices. These include continuous and regular visits by the field based staff in order to guide, advice, direct and motivate them.

Besides the massive problems arising from oil spillages, there is also the cutting of immature mangroves which is predominantly the source of fuel currently available to the fish processors in fishing communities. Adegbulugbe (1994) reported that the demand for fuel wood is expected to be risen to about 2,134,000 metric tons, while the supply would increase to about 28,400 metric tons by the year 2030. He suggested development of appropriate fish processing equipment that will reduce fuel (wood) consumption. The women in the rural communities lack basic social infrastructural facilities to use more sophisticated method of preserving fish; as a result they preserve their fresh fish by traditional methods which are characterized with low-batch capacities and long processing methods. Just like their counter parts in other parts of Nigeria they perform certain economic responsibilities within the family as wives, mothers, farmers and breadwinners. They are the principal care giver of the children and the aged. Even though they are food producers, harvesters and cook, they are also expected to perform the function of wage earners. This is because the intra housing income distribution pattern and the rise of matriarchal household in the country, coupled with poverty, force them to take active financial role in their families. Most of them are uneducated and therefore unemployed outside the home, their major source of livelihood is subsistence farming as they comprise 60 to 80% of the agricultural labor force and account for 90% of family food supply\u00e2\u0080\u009d it is also worthy of note that despite the agony of these women, 90% of them still rely on the use of other crude implements like cutlasses, hoes, knives and poor processing tools to carry out their economic activities. In many rural fishing communities, the infrastructure for post-harvest processing and preservation of fish, especially during peak fishing seasons is inadequate. As a result, losses reach 40 per cent of total catch by weight. Such losses not only have detrimental impact on the socioeconomic life of fishing communities but reduce the amount of animal protein available to large segments of the population. _x000D_\nTo ameliorate all these challenges Morgan Smart Development Foundation (MSDF) will use the $25,000 to provide improved fish smoking oven called the Chorkor Fish Smoking Ovens for the poor but resilient rural women workers. The proposed improved Chorkor Fish Smoking Oven is developed from appropriate technology, built from local materials to communities preference and specifications, uses up to 80% less fuel, has high fish smoking capacity, is faster and healthier to use, and supplies a uniform and better products that attracts higher prices. The oven can actually smoke about 100 fishes of good size on each tray and depending on the size of the fish and the number of racks provided. A Chorkor oven of 3 racks can process a minimum of 300 fish of considerable size within 3-6 hours to achieve the desired low moisture content. The project implementation process/activities will include; Mobilization & Sensitization of beneficiaries on the project, Selection of Beneficiaries, Construction of double chambered Chorkor oven with smoking trays and smoking covers enclosed in a Banda/shed house to ensure uninterrupted operations by shielding the women from direct sunlight or rain, Formation of Project Implementation Committee / training of youths in the communities on construction, use and management of the tools. The selected trained youths will be tasked with ensuring maintenance and construction of additional Chorkor fish smoking tools to other workers in the communities and training of the women leaders from the cooperative group in business and enterprise development to enable the women employ commercial and business approach as to effectively manage their businesses. The business skills will include Financial Management, Saving and Credit Management, Micro-credit, Enterprise development (wealth creation) and Group Memberships. The training methodology to be employed for training the women will be basically drawn from the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) based in Washington DC, USA. It is based on three (3) methodologies which are Appreciative inquiry, Adult learning theory and Experiential learning cycle. The appreciative inquiry and adult learning theory are predicated on the fact that adult learn best when they can identify immediate uses for the new knowledge and skills and when the subject matter directly relates to their own life experiences. Adult learners bring a lot of information even at their level and talent that influences their own learning and facilitates new learning amongst their peers. Experiential learning cycle is based on the process that people learn best by participating directly in their own learning. Morgan Smart Development Foundation (MSDF) has successfully carried out a baseline study on socioeconomic, health and livelihood systems in the communities inclusive of collating data on the state of women processors/co-operative groups in the communities. The data provided insight into local history and current practice as well as physical inspection of present traditional method of fish processing in the communities which revealed the poor state of the traditional smoking ovens. The improved oven when constructed will be handed over to three (3) identified and selected women fish processing co-operative groups made up of twenty (25) members per group (75 women) from three rural fishing communities in the Niger Delta.

We have been working with some international women volunteers, which lead to the launch of some branded products under the name of OlaRe in Europe.

We work towards putting a brand value on handcrafted silk accessories produced by women artisans in Cambodia, which can ensure a fair and sustainable income to the women artisans we work with.

Buyers are looking for bargains, which is difficult to secure via artisan production despite the relatively low labor costs in Cambodia. If we want to continue to pay fairly women, keep them in the workforce and not loose them in the poverty cycle, we need to secure not only considerable increase in sales, but also find ways to maintain, or even increase the value of these products. There are some good international examples, for instance in the coffee sector, when adding a brand value to a product helped the uptake by bigger market players, which secured prices translatable to higher income to the farmers. OlaRe has been an experiment, with tangible success, and now this initiative is ready to be taken into more markets._x000D_\nBased on our experience working with silk artisans we concluded that putting a brand value to some flagship products is worthwhile, and allows to explore market segments which can secure sustainably fair income to women silk artisans, beyond the current scale of Loom\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s.

This past year we launched our first set of workshops for the women and they were hugely successful. With the $25,000 we would be able to continue to fund and support our ongoing expenses, programs and trainings to take our women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s center to the next level.  At the Women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Center, we work together to shape culturally relevant curriculum and offer the best opportunities for development and daily inspiration. Our classes cover a range of topics, including parenting, human rights, health, stress management and self-confidence. We also have courses in vocational training that include sewing, cooking, gardening, husbandry, computer education, business and entrepreneurship to help women and girls in the surrounding region. Inspiring the next generation by showing them that an education is the best way to break down social and economic barriers so we spend a lot of time on literacy, helping the women read and write in both Nepali and English. We want to fund programs for widows, socially vulnerable and destitute women within the community thus encouraging women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s welfare, empowerment, gender equality as well as positive community relations. Our women are working to ensure their own girls are educated, which reduces the risk of exploitation, encourages delayed childbirth and ultimately leads to a more skilled and productive labor force in the community. The programs we will be able to fund with this grant will unite women of all castes, ages and backgrounds. Therefore, the women will become more skilled individually for their future economic benefit and they will be a part of a unique, diverse community of support and trust that will support their confidence and empowerment. We plan to fund the operations and launch of a career-counseling center, open six days a week. This counseling center follows the job-training program. Once our women are provided with the needed skills to create new jobs or better qualify them for employment opportunities, the center will offer support in connecting the women with potential employers.  _x000D_\nWomen face daily battles of stress, depression or other mental health concerns. The consequences can be startling: suicide is the number one killer for girls in Nepal. When a child decides to take her own life as the only way out, something must be done. We opened Surkhet\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s first Mental Health and Counseling Center in 2013 as a way to start addressing this important issue, and provide another way for women and children to reach out for help. Some of the $25,000 will go towards the operational costs of the mental health center and the salaries of the counselors. _x000D_\nThe grant money would also help us fund our large annual community awareness and training program. This 2-3 day event is open to the entire region and we have participants from the local police department and local politicians. This event takes intensive planning and organizing but the support at the political level legitimizes our campaign for awareness about corporal punishment, abuse and sexism. This creates community wide awareness about these issues and encourages the community to change the inequality that is very common in the local society. As more people in the community realize how important change is, the existent caste structure and sexism will decline. As we open a dialogue about equality among genders and castes it creates a safer space among the entire community where people value themselves and each other.

Four service centres in each of 4 subcounties shall be established at a technical institute for purposes of sustainability of using ox-drawn equipment in the area.  Ten girls who have completed their ordinary level of education shall be trained at these institutes in agricultural mechanization so that they can become resource people in their respective communities.

In same way a group of female farmers practicing organic farming shall be educated more on organic farming techniques.It is very common in Cameroon to find single mothers as in recent times as most men shift away from their parental responsibilities the very moment they realize their partners are pregnant for them. Common characteristics of these single mothers are; they are young, jobless, not educated or partially educated but are from very poor backgrounds, have not benefitted from any skill training, lack star- up capital etc Such an experience giving the poverty level of most of these rural women only leave them more frustrated with no self confidence as they strive to raise their children.

These group of youths are found in rural communities and especially experience generational poverty as it moves from the generation of their parents to their and the chain continues because the poor gets married to the poor, the poor can easily die or poor health care because of poverty._x000D_\nThe vast majority of youths fall under category 3 and 2 follows, making it critical to reach them with accurate information and trainings to unveil the skills they have.

Today in Cameroon, there has been increase in health problems than they were in the past. The main reason explaining this is the fact that many poor farmers fall in the traps of chemicalised fertilizer producers so as to increase their farm yields in a very short time. These fertilizers of course do increase the yields but leave the farmers with not just dependency on it but also a lot of health problems.

A non-profit social enterprise, this project will equipping underemployed young women in Africa to develop as professionals and leaders in women's health and to create new economic opportunities by tapping into the multi-billion-dollar global wellness industry. Starting by engaging young women in the development of the yoga market, we have created a professional development model that incorporates self-discovery to unlock participants\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 innate capacity to transform themselves and their environment. Through this project we will demonstrate how young women, deemed unemployable in the current job market, can be empowered to create employment for themselves and others and be a contribution to the global women's health crisis.  This project trains young, disadvantaged Kenyans to become yoga teachers and professionals through a model that empowers them to actively develop the market for their skills, including identifying and creating new market opportunities. At the same time, the model cultivates a culture of inclusion and community service, and makes the health and wellness benefits of a practice like yoga, previously a luxury of the wealthy in Africa, accessible to low- and middle-income communities. With the $25,000 grant we will implement a three part program. _x000D_\nFirst, Africa Yoga Project will facilitate 22 young women from Kenya's urban slums in a 100 hour training to teach Pre-Natal and Post-Natal Yoga. This training will address optimal well-being practices for women's reproductive, cardiovascular and community health. It will also focus on preparing and planning women mentally, emotionally physically for childbirth, motherhood and family planning. Yoga, proven to reduce pre and post natal depression, addresses both the physical body and the attitudes and empowerment of the young women we work with. The training will rely on Africa YogaProject's professional development model that combines self-discovery, community outreach, skills training, and market development, all of which will put these young women in control of their own career opportunities while also bringing wellness benefits to their communities. The young women coming into the program have rough lives in the unsafe environment of the urban slums, some of them perpetrating violence and crime themselves and 40 percent with only a primary school education. The focus on self-discovery is critical in helping them shift their mindset about what is possible for their lives and has had a transformative effect on many of them. They simultaneously learn to be professionals and develop a specific skillset (teaching yoga throughout the lifecycle of a women's health) that they can deploy immediately to continue learning._x000D_\nSecondly, after the training each of the 25 young women will engage in a one year 'Learn and Earn' model - where they utilize there newfound teaching skills and are employed by Africa Yoga Project to teach weekly classes to over 10,000 young people in the urban slums. This year will allow the young women to develop their professional skills while bringing health and wellness benefits to low-income women in the urban slums. Each woman will be required to identify and enroll their communities for the free classes themselves, enabling them to build additional skills as they contribute to development of the yoga market. We have identified over 40 locations that we will deliver these free services to. Notably, we have received partnership from the Langata Women's Prison (Kenya's largest Women's Prision), Remand Girls School (Youth Prison for Girls), and Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), Kenya's largest source of free HIV testing and counseling. The outreach program, in addition to classes facilitated by the students at the Africa Yoga Project studio, contribute to each student\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 200-hour requirement.

As the year ends, they will be educated experienced and empowered professionals that can create their own offerings that bridge the gap between the demand for preventative wellness services in in Kenya, both in the urban slums and in the middle and upper class. We will use our proven model to advertise and promote these classes to the burgeoning middle and upper class that pay for service.

Most rural women shy away from talking about their sexuality and thus engage in sexual practices without the necessary information or materials to prevent them from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases as well as unwanted pregnancies. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSTATISTICS_x000D_\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, over 50% of girls aged 15-19 years are sexually active, and over half of these give birth before age 20 (Senderowitz 1995). Early sexual debut is often associated with the risk of unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, gynaecological complications, maternal death and STI/HIV infection (Ondimu 1997). The main factors contributing to high pregnancy rates among teenagers include lack of knowledge about contraceptives as well as early marriage accompanied by the need to prove one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s fertility (Ajayi et al. 1991, Ondimu 1997, Toroitich-Ruto 1997). The fact that reproductive health care programmes to cater for the needs of young people are sparse and scattered aggravates the issue._x000D_\nFollowing a research conducted by UNICEF in 2012, the prevalence of HIV among young males     between 15-19 years of age was found to be 1.8% while that of females was 3.6%. On top of that, a recent study conducted by avert.org in 2012 showed that women between the ages of 15 and 24 were four times more likely to become infected with HIV/AIDS than their male counterparts. A quarter of these women had been exposed to HIV/AIDS through violent sexual contact._x000D_\nFrom the findings above, it is clear that women are at a disadvantage when dealing with the HIV menace. Measures clearly have to be put in place to prevent the spread of the virus amongst young women as well as preventing them from catching other sexually transmitted diseases as well as early pregnancy. The young rural women need to be empowered with the information necessary to face these challenges and this project is directed toward achieving that objective. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nPROJECT OUTLINE AND IMPLEMENTATION_x000D_\nA solution to address these problems is a mobile application that serves the following purposes:_x000D_\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tprovides women with 24/7 access to contraceptive information and usage_x000D_\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tallows them to order contraceptives which will be delivered to them once they have accumulated a few orders in that geographical region_x000D_\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tgives them a forum for reporting sexual abuse and place a request to order post exposure prophylaxis drugs if sexually abused_x000D_\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\tgives them access to phone numbers of counseling centers so they can access counseling facilities over the cell phone _x000D_\nThis mobile application shall be easily downloadable and run by a team that is able to quickly address the girls\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 issues and give them appropriate responses._x000D_\nThe application will offer women and girls vital information including the accessibility of condoms within the women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s locality. Alternatively, condoms can be delivered to the area on a monthly basis if there are none accessible to them in the vicinity.

ICT capacity-building and training is essential for women entrepreneurs in Malawi to benefit from the opportunities which ICTs offer.  Literacy constraints where many women cannot read or write constrain their use of certain ICTs.  Basic training which show women entrepreneurs how to use mobile phones, computers, social media and other ICTs are strongly needed._x000D_\nAn entrepreneur is defined as a person who is very innovative or in some cases a business person. In most developing countries more especially in Malawi  there are more women carrying out various business activities but there is a common trend where by women are sidelined from enjoying the benefits of ICT.  Some of the reasons why women are being neglected from enjoying the benefits of ICT are lack of skills, resources, illiteracy and many other reasons._x000D_\nUnequal power relations between men and women in our society have resulted to different access and participation and control of ICT.  Without women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s participation in all spheres of life poverty will not be eradicated. Limited access to ICT for women has the effect of reducing the countries competiveness in the global market. Information and Communication technologies have open up new opportunities for people in developing countries especially women._x000D_\nAs technology on electronic devices continues to emulsify the importance of ICT and its opportunities it can offer to women entrepreneurs for better networking and information access cannot be overemphasized. The benefits of networking which is a form of partnership, and the importance of widening this networking to include non-homogeneous type of networks which are not centered on gender, nationality, etc. is well known. They bring all the participants to a common ground. While persisting challenges exist especially in rural areas, effective use of ICTs is helping women entrepreneurs to overcome several barriers.  _x000D_\nEffective use of ICT by women entrepreneurs will therefore strengthen their small and medium enterprises (SME\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s) and allow the business to grow such that their families will be income sufficient.

If discovered early and managed with simple tools (e.g. low-dose aspirin, diet change), the progression of both gestational diabetes and hypertension into NCDs later in life can be reversed or mitigated. MaMaBy Care would provide women with appropriate early diagnosis, facilitating appropriate prevention. _x000D_\nEmployment: Our programme aims to create employment for women, providing them with training and a reliable source of income.

The precise numbers of employees that will receive training are listed in our Results Statement._x000D_\nDuring the first year of operation, MaMaBy is committed to reaching 100 pregnant women.

Policy makers have urged for effective implementation of preventative and early diagnostic strategies to ensure health infrastructures are not crushed under the burden of treating millions suffering from preventable NCDs. 80% of the NCD-attributable deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Globally, over 250 million slum dwellers suffer from NCDs. For them, the debilitating effect of NCDs is exacerbated by poverty, lack of basic medical services and the lingering presence of infectious diseases. _x000D_\nMaMaBy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Solution: MaMaBy integrates NCD management into maternal care to deliver a dual intervention - diagnose early manifestations of NCDs in the mothers and prevent inherent passage of NCD risk to their children. MaMaBy would use the Project Inspire investment to set up community groups in the slums of Mumbai, where pregnant women will come together to receive our dual health intervention - MaMaBy Food and MaMaBy Care. Sensitive to their everyday needs, MaMaBy Food provides these women with a nutritious product to help them carry a healthy baby. Simultaneously, within the community groups, these women will also receive regular screening for early manifestations of NCDs (MaMaBy Care).

The impact of NCDs goes beyond just the health of the mother: maternal health and nutrition, before and during pregnancy, are inextricably linked to the child's risk of developing NCDs such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. The mother's nutritional intake during pregnancy is particularly important, with nutrient deficiencies and inappropriate overfeeding causing low-birth weight  and overweight infants respectively; these infants are more susceptible to developing the above-mentioned NCDs in the future. _x000D_\nHOW? MaMaBy Food takes popular local recipes, such as the samosa, and improves their nutritional content using natural ingredients; this provides mothers with essential micro- and macro-nutrients during pregnancy and thus mitigates the NCD risk associated with malnutrition._x000D_\n_x000D_\nMaMaBy Care_x000D_\nWHY? No longer just regarded as a disease of the elderly, some of the biggest NCD killers, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, first manifest during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes affects 15% of pregnant women worldwide, and untreated it can lead to obstructed labour; hypertensive disorders complicate 5-8% of pregnancies._x000D_\nHOW? MaMaBy Care provides basically trained health workers with simple diagnostic tools, combined with advanced analytical algorithms, to allow screening and monitoring  for NCD risk in pregnant women._x000D_\n_x000D_\nProgram infrastructure: MaMaBy's programme will be carried out by women for women. We would train and employ women in the production and distribution of our food products, as well as the acquisition and processing of medical data. The training which women and girls would receive from MaMaBy's programme would provide them with transferrable skills, raising their employability even beyond their time with MaMaBy.  _x000D_\nMaMaBy's programme would alleviate some of the growing long term burden of NCDs, whilst simultaneously satisfying some of the current needs of women and girls in low resource settings.

It will be important that these apps are engaging, easy to use, and accessible enough that women are independently motivated to use the app, without too much oversight from the program._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis innovation expands the scope of the CommCare platform for existing users by creating avenues for them to gain knowledge on topics they decide. A large emphasis will be placed in the design stage through exploratory fieldwork with CHWs current users of CommCare. Early on, this will include focus group discussions to assess opportunities and interest areas. In later stages, this will include extensive rapid prototyping of suggested content in various app designs._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn 2015, our goal is to test 15 co-designed Social Apps which contain different kinds of content with 100 community health workers.

It would be one of the first glimpses into the informational needs of women at the base of the pyramid._x000D_\nThe Project Inspire grant will allow Dimagi to answer the call to action to bridge the mobile gender gap.

Dimagi is pushing the envelope for mHealth and testing Social Apps as a means of empowering women as themselves, in the many other roles they play during their lives._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA detailed budget and project implementation plan is included. Ground preparation will involve conducting focus group discussions with women users of CommCare at five rural sites. The pilot phase will involve developing Social Apps on site with CHWs based on their feedback from focus group discussions. Apps will be installed on the phones of a small group of users to understand usage patterns. We will collect information from users and other community members about content and design and rapidly iterate to include their feedback. Followed by the piloting and rapid iteration and development of applications, a large proportion of the funding will be used to deploy and evaluate Social Apps at a rural site with 100 CHWs. Dimagi will train 100 existing users of the CommCare platform on basic premise of the applications and then monitor application usage remotely.

In addition, the community members are often viewed as uncivilized by others due to their prior nomadic lifestyle. This leads to discrimination that hinders their ability to find jobs and support their families. As a result, the Community of Potters in Cyaruzinge face extreme poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment. _x000D_\nTo promote community development, Health Development Initiative supported Cyaruzinge villagers to start income-generating activities such as pottery making and basket weaving.

The cooperative received an initial training sponsored by the Kigali City Council, which provided the 33 women with basic weaving skills; however their capacity was limited and they were unable to create colored baskets or designs. The women also faced many challenges in the beginning due to discrimination and lack of resources. They did not have housing, so they worked under trees in their village where their work was at risk of being tarnished by the elements. They also had trouble finding markets for their products due to discrimination in the marketplace. Many women took time away from raising children, doing household chores for neighbors, or begging on the streets to do their weaving and found it difficult to support their families on the small income it was generating. As a result, women began dropping out of the cooperative._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSince 2010, the community has also come very far in terms of improving their lifestyles and fighting discrimination in the community, which has improved access to markets for selling products for the community members. In 2013, HDI sponsored an intensive training for cooperative members in partnership with Agaseke to master the art of weaving. Through the training, the women gained confidence in their skills, moral was improved and the cooperative was restored to 25 members. Now, the women are re-energized and focused on strengthening their cooperative, expanding their efforts to reach 55 women in their community, and using their knowledge to empower other Community of Potters women throughout the country. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn partnership with the Dusabane cooperative, HDI proposes a project that is divided into three parts: handicraft skills strengthening and diversification, business management and entrepreneurial skills cultivation, and an introduction to marketing and communications. The first part involves 6 months of intensive artisan skills trainings. During this time period, the 7 master weavers in the community will work with women at beginner/intermediate levels to improve their skills and ensure everyone can produce high-quality baskets. The cooperative will also undergo training with Agaseke to learn how to diversify their skills and develop expertise in making different products (i.e. bags, shoes, key holders, hair clips, table mats, jewelry, etc.).  Money will be used to support training fees, handicraft materials, and cooperative member facilitation for the first 6 months to give the cooperative members time to master their crafts and become profitable. It will also sponsor a small center where the cooperative can meet to make goods and display and sell their products. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThere are many \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093copy cat\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d businesses in Rwanda, and cooperatives that specialize in handicrafts are one of them. The cooperative members know that if they want to be competitive in the future, they will need to expand their business and entrepreneurial skills. For this reason, the second part of the project involves workshops in business management and entrepreneurship. In the fourth month of the project, cooperative members will receive a workshop from Agaseke in business development and finance management. This will help the cooperative to professionalize their business and integrate basic finance and organizational systems.  In the seventh month, the cooperative will undergo an entrepreneurship workshop through the Babson-Rwanda Entrepreneurship center. The workshop will give the women an in-depth introduction to entrepreneurship and how to identify community needs and solutions. They will be challenged to develop business proposals to address solutions to community needs, and the best projects will be sent to a current HDI donor who is interested in supported small business ventures._x000D_\n_x000D_\nMany members of the cooperative never finished primary school, so they were never exposed to English. As a result, it is incredibly difficult for them to be competitive in selling their goods to expatriates. It is also impossible for them to communicate their stories and needs to potential supporters without the help of an intermediary like HDI. This is why we propose to include English training in months 7-12 of the project timeline. HDI\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s M&E and Communications Officer will also provide the community with a 5-day communications and marketing workshop to introduce the cooperative to marketing and help them develop a marketing strategy.  The English and marketing skills will make the cooperative members more competitive in the Rwandan marketplace by giving them the skills to communicate with international visitors and make their business most appealing. It will also give them the capacity to communicate directly with supporters, understand exactly what HDI is communicating to donors, and ultimately become less reliant on NGOs to improve their lives.

We also believe that the language lessons will enhance the success of their businesses by helping them to effectively advertise their products and to interact with customers. Furthermore, an education of their health and civil rights will help them to appreciate their self-worth more fully. \nThe grant period can be viewed as the pilot phase of our project; we will learn from our mistakes and take strength in areas of success so that the training continuously improves with time. It is important to set challenging but realistic targets which will be used to measure the success of our training phase. Firstly, it is important to look at the economic success of the project. The central aim of this project is to provide young women with the skills to make themselves economically self-sufficient. Consequently, we are committed to train each woman to a level where they can successfully begin a career as a tailor / seamstress. We are also committed to supporting each woman on completion of the project, advising them on them on their business plans and offering to sell their products in local markets. It must be noted that there is a possibility that one or more women may choose to end their training early, or they may choose a different career path on completion. While we will support these women as best we can they have the right to make their own choices and this must be respected. It is also important to evaluate the social success of the project, focusing on trainees overall level of well-being and changes in self-perception. \nThe evidence used to assess economic success is relatively straightforward. After initial discussions with community members we can confidently predict that the majority of the graduates will choose to sell their products in partnership with Rachna Satrei. In this case we will keep records of all expenditures and sales so that we can accurately assess economic success (as a not-for-profit we will not make any money ourselves during this venture). We will establish a target amount and minimum amount of profit (US dollars per month). The minimum amount will allow the individual to be economically self-sufficient whereas the target amount will also allow them to support their families and/or make improvements to their situation (for example purchasing land, improving their home, or purchasing livestock). In cases where the graduate decides to pursue their career independently we will introduce monthly meetings where their finances are examined. In addition to determining the economic success of the project these meetings will enable us to offer continued support to every graduate (not exclusively those who chose to form a partnership with Rachna Satrei), it will also encourage them to keep accurate records of their finances. It is more challenging to quantify the social success of the project. Nevertheless, through informal meetings (as mentioned above), questionnaires, and recorded interviews we aim to assess the levels of social improvement for each graduate.  \nMinnesota Veterans for Progress_x000D_\nPrivate donors from Australia_x000D_\n_x000D_\nBoth of the above donors contributed to cover the costs of the building phase of the project.", "project_name": "Vocational Sewing Project: Enhancing Employability through Vocational and Skill Development Training among Women and Adolescent Girls", "sectors": "", "project_summary": "The costs of this project can be divided into two sections: costs related to the building phase and costs related to the training phase-_x000D_\nCosts related to the building phase include those incurred from purchasing land, purchasing building materials (including basic building materials and infrastructural materials such as wiring and pipes), hiring tools and machinery for construction, and hiring laborers (two employees of Rachna Satrei also work on construction voluntarily).The total cost of the building phase is $28,180 (US). The cost of the land is not included in this total as it was rented on a long term lease by Rachna Satrei director Phoungmaly Nhean, prior to the start of construction. A breakdown of costs is can be viewed in the attached project budget. The NGO has already secured funds to complete the building phase of the project with the help of Minnesota Veterans for Progress and private donors from Australia. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nRachna Satrei requires $25,000 from Project Inspire to complete the first year training phase of our Vocational Sewing Project. On completion of the building phase we will select 25 disadvantaged, vulnerable women, from a rural community in the Siem Reap province, to take part in our project. These women will be selected through a rigorous interview process and in close consultation with senior community members. We are particularly looking for young women who are struggling to find employment, this may be due to a limited skill set or simply because of a lack of opportunities within their community. Women in this situation are often forced to migrate to different regions or internationally in search of work. Migration increases vulnerability as women with no money or family/community support are left open to exploitation (this is discussed in greater detail in a later section). Once the 25 women have been selected the training phase will commence.

We want to showcase what women can do. Over the last three years we have gradually grown our nugget of an idea into a bold, plan for changing. Three years ago, we started in one of the schools where we teach self-defense with a small entrepreneurship program. We provided eight weeks of lessons learning about the practicalities of small business. After the twenty girls completed the lessons, they worked together to form a business selling donuts to their classmates. The girls earned a profit of about $1 a week. Emboldened from their success, the girls broke off into groups of four and started a project with 1,000 KES. Their projects included selling donuts, bead work, socks and sweets.The girls continue with their project and with making a small project. We anticipate with a portion of the $25,000 we will be able to provide the program Dadapreneurs to our eight schools where we work with approximately 800 girls between the ages of 9-18. (Dadapreneurs is so called because the word for sisters in Swahili is Dada.)_x000D_\nLast year, we also started a small entrepreneurship program for young women ages 19-35. We currently have about ten women where Box Girls provided seed funding for their project who are about two months into the project. Box Girls staff work closely with the women to work through challenges. So far, we are addressing challenges in providing child care, family obligations, changing demands from family and changing the product to unforeseen market challenges. The women also are collectively facing the downturn in the market due to the security situation in Kenya. Learning ways to confront challenges and deal with conflict is important and the Box Girls staff stick with the young women helping them with the problems. For example, one young woman was living with her mother and has a young child. She wanted to be able to afford his school fees, as no education is completely free in Nairobi. Once her mother say that she was earning a little bit she took a step back and stopped providing food or working as much. The mother, who thought she had the school fees earned, now had to use that money for food. Working with the mother and young entrepreneur, Box Girls staff is able to make suggestions and ensure a conversation occurs discussing the way forward for the family. Box Girls teaches self-defense to girls and women in five different slums in Nairobi through zones. In each zone, girls taught in schools and girls who have graduated school can come together for additional sport. The women in the entrepreneurship program are women from the Kariobangi zone. With a part of the $25,000, Box Girls would increase the number of young women allowed to participate in Dadapreneurs by offering the opportunity to all zones. We anticipate each year approximately 200 Box Girls graduate from secondary school without employment or additional schooling opportunities. We would provide them a start down the path forward._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe are also currently starting an on-line radio station as an entrepreneurship project to give women and girls a voice. The radio station will be run by five young girls with two Box Girl staff members and a professional adviser to assist them. Not only will the radio station provide programming opportunities for girls in the community but also provide a business opportunity for the girls to showcase the entire community. Learning about programming, marketing and dealing with production companies and local talent will provide the young women the opportunity to take a leadership position in the community. Currently, the slums in Nairobi have a population in excess of one million. The online radio station will use current technology to be played through an App on a Smart Phone allowing access to the radio station locally through cell phone technology rather than relying on the internet in Nairobi, which can be sporadic due to inconsistent broadband capabilities in the city and electricity. We will use part of the $25,000 to support this small entrepreneurship project._x000D_\n", "project_details": "We are solving a number of problems with this project. We are directly challenging the social norm that women don't have a voice and can't be providers.

In general, however, the grantees\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 reflections give far greater emphasis to how engagement in Safar activities has led to a range of affective and social outcomes such as a greater sense of self-esteem, self-confidence and self-determination, as well as the building of relationships with people in the Arab World \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c whether entrepreneurs, artists, human rights activists, development practitioners, intellectuals. Youth also give importance to relationships established with organizations, places, cultures and histories during their journeys (often their first) to particular countries in the Arab World. Given the importance young people award to connections and relationships gained, it is perhaps not surprising that they also report that their attitudes, particularly in relation to values and views of young people and of the Arab World, are regularly challenged through their engagement in Safar activities. Our recent impact research shows clearly the relation between mobility and individuals higher engagement in their own communities. This creates higher awareness to disadvantaged communities as well as an opportunity for connection and change. Another important result of the impact mobility research is the relation between youth travel and their better economic status few years after the trip. They usually link it to connections made or ideas generated through the trip that opens their vision towards taking entrepreneurial steps that benefits their society. _x000D_\nWe live in a globalized era yet we remain isolated from each other.

However, and despite our best efforts in this regard, we found that during the first two years the percentage of young women traveling was much higher than that of young men (70% compared to 30% males) and in the following years this ratio has dropped to the disadvantage of girls to the exact opposite.

First, we could increase the number of street-sweeper ladies empowered up to 30. So, they are able to obtain their additional income and send their kids to school.

We are trying to do the business together with street-sweeper ladies in our university by involving them in the business activities. It is established in a mission to give additional income for the street-sweepers so that their families can have higher income, therefore get them out of poverty level and create better future for their families. It is crucial for us to address this issue because they depict a social problem happening in front of our eyes and is yet to be solved. Currently, they can only get around $3.7/day as their wages for the whole family or less than $2/day per capita, which is below the minimum living cost standard set by The Jakarta Wage Council as $199/month. In FloHope Indonesia, the street-sweepers are taught about how to create flannelette flowers and they will routinely give their creations to us for an exchange of money, as we are the ones who market the product. They will also get financial planning education so that they can allocate their additional incomes for important accounts such as housing, nutrition, education, and health._x000D_\nWhat makes us different from other similar businesses are: 1) we offer social value; 2) we deliver a full package for people to express their feelings and not only will we seize moments, we create them; 3) we have an immense potential target market._x000D_\nFirst of all, we offer social value to consumers. Once they are buying FloHope Indonesia\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s product, they will know that they are actually benefiting not only themselves but also the street-sweepers. However, unlike many social businesses in Indonesia, we do not want people to buy our products because they feel sorry for street-sweeper ladies; we want them to buy because we have good quality. That is why we will give the social information on goody-bags which is given on the time of delivery: meaning we are conveying the information after-sales, not the opposite._x000D_\nSecondly, we have a full-package product. It is sold with cards on which customers can write messages for the people they want to give the flowers to. It is also sold with pretty goody-bags which create easiness for the customers as a packaging for the gifts. We also try to innovate as much as we can to create valuable moments for customers by providing additional value-added products for certain moments, for example creating Polaroid picture-taking service during graduation ceremony._x000D_\nLastly, we have huge potential market. Unlike many social businesses doomed to fail in Indonesia because of the struggle find a market for the product, we have already picked one specific target market which will hopefully bring much income for the business: graduation ceremonies. Graduation ceremonies happen every month in Indonesia, with its numerous universities, both public and private. Our product is also suitable for high-school and middle-school graduation ceremonies. Those facts, added with potential market for marriage and other ceremonial occasions, created immense potential market for FloHope Indonesia. _x000D_\nAfter giving the ability to produce flannelette flowers, we will train the street-sweeper ladies to run their business independently.

First, we have a plan to empower more street-sweeper ladies. So far, we could just empower 6 women. We have a target to empower 20-30 street-sweeper ladies in our campus, and to do that, we need additional funds to expand our business. We also want to establish a FloHope Store. Currently, we only sell our product via online media (twitter, facebook), and we think that if we have a store, it will increase our revenue. In addition, we could also jointly sell our products with other social enterpreneurship movement in our university. Lastly, we want to establish FloHope Indonesia in other campus in Indonesia.

It will achieve this through the formation of a self-managed community savings group, called Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILC).

Without means to earn a living income, these women risk sliding back into hopelessness. To avoid this, towards the end of the project AOAV encouraged the formation of SILC groups in several districts. This project will allow the former beneficiaries of Rutegama to also benefit from the SILC methodology, in addition to entrepreneurship and agricultural training which will multiply the impact of the SILC. Priorities will be given to women with disabilities aged 18-35 and other vulnerable women will be invited to join based on spaces remaining. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSILC is a methodology developed by Catholic Relief Service (CRS) with proven success in Burundi. Based on the experience of Biraturaba (a local NGO who have helped over 18,000 people to form SILC groups), groups successfully utilizing SILC methods for savings and lending have achieved a 56% increase in income among beneficiaries, and 90% of those who took loans had clear improvement in their economic conditions after two years. This approach is suitable for the Burundian context where access to credit is limited, especially for those with disabilities and survivors of the civil war. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSILC: The SILC groups will develop their own rules; they will meet regularly and will save each week a pre-determined amount of money. Shortly after, the members will borrow from the funding pool and will later repay with the interest rates set out by the group. As a result, the SILC group will make profits; as the profit increases so does the amount of money available for lending, creating a continuous cycle.  There will also be a special savings fund for emergency situations affecting group members.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nSkills for developing sustainable income-generating activities: Five women in each group (20 women in total) selected by the groups themselves will be trained in basic entrepreneurship (5 days on market assessment, business plan creation and management by AOAV\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b4s local partner The Burundi Business Incubator), leadership (2 days by a local expert) and sustainable agriculture (4 days by a local expert). The sustainable agriculture training will assist women to improve the yields and develop effective tools and sustainable farming management practices. Due to scarce resources and land to cultivate, this training will bring farming knowledge and techniques that will teach women on how to grow more with less land, water, fertilizer, while preserving resources.

Productive brain has been moving out of the state due to lack of employment opportunities and good education. It has lead to low literacy, GDP and general awareness amongst the community living within the state. Women are one of the most vulnerable sections of Bihar with limited authority and voice on decision-making. Moreover in patriarchal social structure their education gets least importance. Samoolam believes in bringing the self worth, pride along with social and economical independence for the women who are underprivileged in remote villages.

However, the barriers to women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s entrepreneurship remain with women facing greater obstacles in accessing credit, training, networks and information, as well as legal and policy constraints. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe promotion of women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s entrepreneurship can play a particularly important role in conflict-affected countries.  Although destruction affects all, conflict often leaves women to carry the double burden of economic and family responsibilities. Women who can no longer rely on steady earnings from male household members during times of hardship must often make ends meet by engaging in informal micro-income-generating activities. Giving women a stake in the national reconstruction process by investing in their economic participation, including through entrepreneurship, is crucial for effective and sustainable development of the already-fragile economies of conflict-affected societies.

The dire current situation in refugee camps could have a ripple effect on several generations to come if relief efforts are not targeted towards sustainable projects.Through the FITE project we firstly aim to preserve the heritage and culture of the Syrian refugees through acquiring the written form of their native language. Also, by acquiring a skill we hope to provide these women with a perpetual access to employment & means of sustainable income, even in the case of another forced or voluntary displacement.This project also aims to slowly change the pre-established gender norms within this community and shift the balance by positioning women as active member of their society.When women enter the labor market they begin to feel empowered and thus become a different role model to their own children. By empowering young mothers we also aim to empower their families through meaningful life experiences.\nThrough FITE we aim to fight unemployment amongst the Bar Elias community of Syrian refugees. By empowering the women within the group we help create alternative modes of income for each household and help provide better overall living conditions. Illiteracy is a major hurdle standing in the way of the economic independence of women but also a major barrier to the future of this community. Indeed, the women are a key element in the education of the children, and their inability to be able, for instance, to help their kids with their homework is a true impediment. By offering these women alternatives to their current situation, this program can give hope to the community and could turn the traumatic experience of displacement into a beneficial opportunity, and alleviate injustice through acquiring new skills. And finally this program will also support the Sawa grass-root initiative by implementing programs based on field needs started by young Syrian men and women.\nTeaching 100 women Hairdresser Make up artist skills, through a 5 weeks program.

The proposed project is a continuation of our work with the women of this community in our women centers in the Bekaa valley._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSawa for Development and Aid is a youth initiative, founded as a reaction to the dire gap in fulfilling the needs of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Our initiative- now registered NGO in Lebanon- believes that humanitarian relief and development is a matter of social justice, and aims to raise the living standards of Syrian refugees particularly, and the families in need from all nationalities more generally, to the basic standards of a dignified life._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor the past 6 months, Sawa has been operating in the Bekaa in a locally rented building improvised as school and community center, among other locations. _x000D_\nThrough extensive field research, focus groups and observation we have identified local needs and have been addressing them through our work. So far, we have launched a local school for the Syrian Children as well as educational activities. _x000D_\nOnce a week, the school hosts psychosocial support group sessions for women, led by a Female Psychiatrist- a Syrian refugee herself. Through these activities we have been meeting with more Syrian families and have been establishing trust and engaging in more meaningful conversations._x000D_\nOur ongoing work with the Bar Elias community has helped us identify the next point of intervention that could help bring more support to this community._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe average family in Bar Elias is of 5 members and the majority of households today are dependent on humanitarian aid. Through our field research we identified obstacles that make access to steady income possible. _x000D_\nFirstly, the Bekaa does not have the capacity to provide work opportunities for this great number of refugees. _x000D_\nSecondly, when jobs are available they are usually physical labor type tasks that are temporary and rarely provide any financial stability. Additionally, those professions are often reserved to men. _x000D_\nAnother unforeseen barrier is that, amongst the sample of refugees that is in contact with the Sawa team, the male figure in 1 in every 3 households is suffering from a serious physical injury that prevents him from performing labor work, thus reducing considerably their access to local jobs. Since the men are traditionally providers amongst this society and faced with all barriers, the community of Bar Elias is left with few possibilities. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nDuring the psychosocial support sessions that are ongoing at the Sawa for Development and Aid women centers, the females have expressed their desire to become providers of their households as well as independent agents in society. This need is enhanced by the fact that many of these families are now females heading households after losing their husbands to death, kidnapping, or detention. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nNaturally our next goal became to empower these women to break the taboo around female providers and thus help them empower their own community. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur identified target is a group of around 100 women, divided into two distinct sub-groups: the older women (age group 40-65 years old) and the young mothers (age group 16-39 years old). Although the two categories have different realities given their age they still share the same needs. About 80% of these women lack a basic skill and around 60% are illiterate._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur initial mission was to fight illiteracy to provide these women with more options. And thus we started a series of Arabic writing and reading classes. Yet attendance to these sessions kept diminishing until we had to cancel the program for lack of turnout. Our team followed up with the community to understand the reasons behind their lack of motivation and identified 3 major barriers. _x000D_\nFirstly, the Arabic written language is very difficult and different from the spoken dialect, making progress very slow and so with no palpable outcome the women felt overwhelmed. _x000D_\nSecondly, they didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t see any concrete and direct use for learning to write and read Arabic especially that their main motivation is to access additional income; so they just lost their motivation. _x000D_\nAnd finally, they felt too old (especially the older group) to be learning what their children were also learning in parallel._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFaced with their lack of motivation, we explored alternative ways to address the initial problem. Through several conversations, the women expressed their desire to learn a skill that could unlock job opportunities. We organized a small poll and the majority voted on taking hairdressing and make-up art classes. In fact this specific line of work is in accord with their culture and how women are viewed in their society. _x000D_\nAnd thus by selecting a rather female oriented skill, they were re-assessing their role within their community without antagonizing the societal hierarchy.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur proposed program aims to build on the motivation of the Women in Syrian refugees camps to achieve economic independence and sustainability, by offering a target fighting of illiteracy through teaching a comprehensive skill._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project aims to start a locally based hairdresser and make-up art school and shop. Through the teaching of the straightforward skills needed for this line of work we will also introduce the basics of writing and reading the Arabic language. The illiteracy program will focus on learning the necessary skills that complement the profession of a hairdresser or make-up artist. For instance, the women will learn the basics of mathematics and introductory classes to technical terms and words, thus giving these women the incentive to become literate._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn the larger scale, by teaching the women a comprehensive skill we also relieve tension with the host community. By changing the status of passive refugees to active members of society we provide the local host with skilled labor as opposed to an economic burden._x000D_\n_x000D_\nTo allow for the full participation of the women, our program will also launch a complementary project targeting the children and offering educational activities, as often women in the camps are the main caretakers for their children and cannot leave them behind._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAs an end note, grassroots organizations like Sawa are leading local development, and are in need of constant support. Rather than being only used by international organization as implementing partners, this is a great opportunity for Sawa to be solving field needs that we very well know, and can solve but lack the resources or funds.

In the context of peace building in Indonesia, peace initiatives by grassroots women is mutually related with the fulfillment of economic needs.

Therefore, in UN Women explained that when women with a stable income, they will be able to take care of their family and be participating in decision making. Peace building problems are solved when women are involved in their communities and society.  Furthermore, women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s economic empowerment is crucial due to a significant contribution to peace building as well as regarded as a key component to elevate equality of women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s rights. Economic development for women is very important to bring a significant contribution for peace building and become main component to create right-equality for women.

We believe that, without affirmative action for women in the economic matters, the strategic position of women in promoting peace would be very difficult. This program is designed to integrate Development and Peace building aspect, which are both of them are inter-related in objective and intervention strategy. Economic empowerment intervention is expected to be a social cohesion between diverse communities both to reduce poverty and social gap that usually be the root cause of conflict in that area. At the same time, women empowerment intervention with different ethnic and religious backgrounds is designed to encourage women participation in decision making and fostering peace in local level. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn the context of Project Inspire grants opportunity with USD$25,000, The Wahid Institute plans to Improvement of sustainable micro-finance service for \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0interfaith women in the community in Depok and Bogor, West Java.

While, The purpose of training on women social microenterprise is to increase management skills of community-based microenterprise so that they can effectively improve their existing microenterprise.

Besides promoting local products, it also familiarizes a joint venture philosophy which does not only seek profits but also gains values as mutual cooperation, mutual respect, collaboration, and mutual support between different communities and faiths. This festival is one of the key of solution that religious diverse community and stakeholder have work out to work together to create harmony between each other.

Our mission is to open local production centers so we can economically empower SC communities  forced into intergenerational prostitution thorough out Northern India starting with the Rajnat, Kanjars, Sansis, Bedia, and Nat communities.  The long term impact is that these communities will have the choice to leave prostitution and no longer have to force their girls into early marriage breaking the vicious cycle they are stuck in now. \nDuring this grant cycle the 50 women and girls that we train, will be financially compensated which will impact the lives of their families as well. Through our training we are building their capacity to bring about economic change for themselves, even if they don't continue to become hired employees of SNF through skill training. Those 50 women will gain confidence from learning new skills. They learn interpersonal skills such as how to work in a team which can help with future employment. We help them open bank accounts and learn how to save the money they earn during this period. \nImpact is not just improving their financial situation but if the women and girls feel empowered enough to have the choice to leave or deter prostitution and are no longer forced into prostitution by their families or into early marriages. Delaying marriage is extremely difficult in this community but we have already seen girls (such as Momal who is 18 and unmarried still) been bold leaders and be able to say, 'No' to their families through the help and support of other girls in the community.

The surveys are to be administered by the program staff, after a consent from is signed by the participants and their parents. It is a short survey with 12 questions, and their names will be attached. It is important that the girls are assured that it will not affect their enrollment. The questions are a mix about skill development, financial tools, and empowerment to measure how much they have learned throughout training.

Most refugees in Israel today, and more than half worldwide, live and work in urban environments where employment opportunities are limited, and their presence often brings them into conflict with local populations as resources are stretched thin. In Israel, where there are currently around 50,000 African asylum seekers living without clear legal status, the concentration of most asylum seekers in the poor neighborhoods of South Tel Aviv has resulted in high levels of tension, occasionally breaking out into violence against one group or the other. Women are frequently the victims of this violence, as rape is used as a tool of dominance. Furthermore, the perceived competition between these two groups has resulted in increasingly draconian policies towards asylum seekers, most recently imprisonment, withdrawal of visas, refusal to process asylum claims and pressure to return to home countries._x000D_\nA significant part of this tension is the result of conflict over resources. Where once Israeli society was welcoming of refugees, excess pressure on South Tel Aviv due to policies that discriminate against asylum seekers in employment, has sparked racism and conflict. Women on both sides suffer from this reality. Microfy believes that investment in the economic development of this area, most particularly through empowerment of women, as the most vulnerable and the most likely to invest in their families, will reduce tensions and increase the average income across demographics._x000D_\n_x000D_\nMicrofy is raising money to improve business literacy and access to credit for low-income Israeli women and African refugees and asylum seekers.  We seek to stimulate the economic, social, and cultural health of South Tel Aviv, an urban area riddled by poverty but teeming with potential, by creating channels to credit and business education.   These two low-income and vulnerable demographics have historically been neglected by the Israeli government\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s development goals   Any funds that Microfy raises will go directly towards improving the quality of program delivery to women interested in business education, seeking to start their own businesses, and business owners already relying on the consultancy and support services offered by Microfy. More specifically, this means recruiting highly qualified professionals to serve as educators and consultants, expanding educational services to include more new entrepreneurs, and improving sustainability for current business owners.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nBut Microfy sees what it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s doing as much more than just creating more channels for business literacy and opportunity to vulnerable demographics living in low-income neighborhoods. Microfy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s two target groups, asylum seekers and Israelis, face different challenges. Yet as women, and as women living in the marginalized urban area of South Tel Aviv, they also share many obstacles that prevent them from realizing their entrepreneurial potential and achieving economic independence.  Microfy thus creates opportunities to not rely on informal markets or subjection to unfair working conditions. Economic independence, is a powerful tool toward empowerment and control over one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s life. Women with an independent source of income earn more, are able to support their families better, and take a larger role in decision making in their families. Small businesses, which can be operated out of the home or in stores close by, provide an opportunity for women to earn money while meeting childcare and other demands. They provide flexibility, and an escape from workplaces where their rights are abused. For many, the idea of opening their own business is important beyond the financial rewards; it is an opportunity to exert a measure of control over their lives, and restore some of the dignity that was attacked in their uprooting.  Strengthening women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s knowledge and confidence to seek income-generating opportunities while recognizing the importance of cultural norms as well has the potential to benefit their families and the community at large.   Microfy recognizes that intercultural tensions and grievances against refugees are often caused by local feelings of disenfranchisement. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nMicrofy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s mission is to support refugees and marginalized women in host communities not only to challenge traditional roles that restrict women and reinforce gender inequality, but also to alleviate the tension created between the host and asylum seeking populations by the perceived threat of their presence among a predominantly Jewish and Israeli demographic.", "project_details": "Isolated and traumatized by their escape from persecution and war, refugees and asylum seekers are forced to rely on the hospitality and generosity of host communities that frequently do not understand or want them.

Sukhibhava aims to tackle contributing factors to gender inequality through provision of products and education that enable and empower women through local female micro-entrepreneurs. Menstrual hygiene management is one of those factors and it is unfairly felt by the under privileged and urban poor. Sukhibhava will hold education sessions and sell menstrual hygiene products to urban poor women who previously did not have access due to economic or awareness factors.  A micro distribution business model has been developed where local entrepreneurial women will distribute and sell products. Working with local women will enable Sukhibhava to build on the trust that these women have already cultivated with their local communities to educate about and distribute menstrual hygiene products like sanitary pads and menstrual cups.  Sukhibhava operates on the premise of full life cycle products. This refers to both to concern for the environmental impact of the product as well as aiming to take the journey towards the adoption of new products and services with the customers it deals with. Which happens on a phase to phase basis starting from education and awareness, to introducing and ensuring 100% utilization of the products, to monthly follows ups ensuring consistent usage to safe disposals of the used products._x000D_\nPreliminary Research:_x000D_\nA survey of 250 women & girls from government schools, urban slum communities and garment factories within the urban limits of Bangalore has provided valuable information as a starting point. _x000D_\nThe survey found that among the sample of 250 women:_x000D_\n-\t78% used uncomfortable, unhygienic or inappropriate methods for menstruation management (including 6.5% who did not want to answer)_x000D_\n-\tThe reasons cited as the main barriers to usage are :_x000D_\n1) Affordability: The 89.3% women felt they have better priorities to spend their money on, like milk and education for their children or groceries for the family._x000D_\n2) Aspiration: The 84.5% of the women expressed that they these products are not meant or made for them but for the higher section of the society._x000D_\n3) Disposal: Most of the urban poor women do not have proper shelters to live in and hence they expressed a strong opinion of not being comfortable in disposing them around where they live._x000D_\n4) Accessibility: 76.5% of the women did not have the awareness or the knowledge to go to a local shop and buy the sanitary pads. They were as uncomfortable as a teenage kid going to a pharmacy and buying contraceptives._x000D_\n-\t86% of women surveyed would be happy to pay for them if provided at an affordable price.

Sukhibhava have partnered with Bella a multinational sanitary products brand in India. A distribution agreement has been made with Bella, to supply packs of 8 pads at a cost of Rs. 16.85 which will be sold at Rs.25 per pack which is lower than the market price. The commercial price of the same quality sanitary pads is Rs.45 , Bella provides it at a subsidized price considering Sukhibhava is a social enterprise. At the end of six months, when a strong distribution model has been built with expected number of consumers, Sukhibhava aims to manufacture its own sanitary pads on a self help group model._x000D_\nMenstrual Cup _x000D_\nSimultaneously the program will trial menstrual cups. Menstrual cups are just starting to gain attention around the world. They are made from medical-grade silicon, and are reusable for up to 10 years meaning a huge reduction in waste. This is especially relevant for open waste piles in the slums. The cup is inserted into the vagina and collects menstrual fluid in a non-leaking container. The container can then be emptied, washed and re-inserted. The holding capacity is much larger than tampons or pads and only needs to be changed once every 12 hours. The cup is not felt once it is inside and which is much more comfortable than pads or alternative items traditionally used. The cup is upfront more expensive, but is cheaper in the long run. Current estimates place the price at Rs. 625 wholesale, which is less than 1 weeks wage for people in the urban slums. The cup would be offered on a micro-finance plan which will be developed as part of the trial. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nModel of Operation:_x000D_\nSukhibhava works as an on-the-ground distributor. For each new location either school, factory or  a urban slum communitySukhibhava staff or trained partners begin a two week induction process and then a trial period of two months with follow ups. The first week is an awareness session, the second is an education and sales session. Follow ups are conducted fortnightly over the trial period in which more women can join at any time. After the two month evaluation is complete the new location will be visited on a regular fortnightly basis for sales and queries. After 6 months in each location, another feedback and question session will be held to monitor and evaluate the impact of new products. _x000D_\nPhase One: Awareness_x000D_\nSukhibhava research has shown that potential customers may take up to 2 sessions of information building before they are comfortable enough to proceed with a purchase. The program will begin with a awareness session, education women about menstrual hygiene and the necessity through a 20 minute video, will be culturally appropriate, sensitive and in a safe environment for women to talk and discuss.

At this point feedback will be sought from women who attended the first session, but have not followed through on education and purchasing. The education and sales sessions will be delivered by our distribution staff and partners, and a fortnightly presence in the camps will continue so that women are able to ask questions or give feedback. Our research showed the women did not buy pads in advance so regular contact is best. Education is developed in collaboration with local women, health professionals and suppliers. It will include information on how to communicate with husbands, families or communities about the issue._x000D_\nPhase Three: Disposal _x000D_\nThe used sanitary pads are collected back from the women on a regular basis. Central collection points like bins will be installed in each of the communities, will be maintained discreetly and by which waste can be collected and stored. Specific arrangements with the manufacturer are in the process of being worked out. Menstrual cups last for up to 10 years, disposal at that point will be discussed, and however more focus will be placed on hygienic disposal of the menstrual fluid. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe business model of Sukhibhava demands 16 female micro-entrepreneurs(Sakhis) across four divisions of Bangalore( North, south, east and west) to sell 2000 packets of sanitary pads to urban poor women through different institutions and partners. Each Sakhi is given three months of probation to reach the target of 2000 with the ongoing support of the operational staff. Sakhi plays an active role in retention of consumers month after of month, which in return helps her reduce work of finding new consumers every month._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Project Inspire grant of USD$25000 will be utilized to set up four manufacturing units in four divisions of Bangalore enabling supply of self made bio-degradable sanitary pads to Sakhis who have already developed a distribution channel and have built a consumer base for themselves._x000D_\nThis is help us create more employment opportunities for women, while providing locally manufactured bio-degradable sanitary pads with increased incentives to the micro-entrepreneurs and increasing the sustainability ratios of Sukhibhava._x000D_\n_x000D_\n", "project_details": "India\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2s gender equality was ranked 132nd of 146 countries by UNDP in 2012.

This project takes place on Rusinga Island, a small island in Kenya.  It is surrounded by Lake Victoria, and it is linked to Mbita point on the mainland by a causeway.  A recent government statistic indicates that Rusinga Island has about 35,000 inhabitants.  The average life expectancy is about 45 years with high number of females than males.  The average income per person averages KES 3,000 ($30) per month.   About 40% of the population on the island suffers from HIV/AIDS.        As the life expectancy is low and HIV/AIDS rate is high, a lot of women end up as widows at a young age.  Many of the women lose their husbands to HIV/AIDS and Malaria, and the women are left to take care of themselves and their children.  Again, due to low life expectancy and high HIV/AIDS, some women are orphans themselves, or they come from poor families.  Thus, the women did not have an opportunity to attend school in the first place or continue their education after primary school, as their families could not afford sending children to school.  _x000D_\nWithout formal education, the widows do not have any vocational or relevant skills to generate any income.  The women have at least three children, but the women cannot afford sending those children to public schools or feeding their children more than one meal a day.  Fortunately, their children attend Sargy Education Center, an organization under our organization that provides orphans and vulnerable children with free and/or affordable education.  Sargy Education Center also provides its pupils with breakfast and lunch, but the children often do not have anything to eat at home. _x000D_\n       The widows are the mothers of our pupils, and they did not have any skills besides gathering firewood\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s or helping the fishermen.  In extreme cases, the women offered themselves sexually to the fishermen to put food on the table.  In our language, we call such practice jaboya, and it is still practiced on Rusinga Island.  Lake Victoria is often overfished, making fish scarce for the residents.  Therefore, buying fish has become competitive, and the only way the women would receive fish is to offer themselves sexually and trade sex for fish.  _x000D_\n      These widows are strong, determined individuals.  To help them maximize their potentials and empower them, we started training them to weave a variety of items such as hats, ropes, and bracelets.  The women sell the items to generate income, but the amount is minimal; each rope sells for KES 30, which is about $0.30.  Weaving and selling the items have not generated enough income for them to improve their situations, so the women themselves came up with an idea to start a garden, a garden of hope._x000D_\n      Sargy will use $25,000 to create 20 gardens of hope.  About 96% of the money will go towards the materials, such as cement, nails, pipes, and seeds, and the other 4% will pay for the labour required to start and finish these gardens.  Each garden will be right next to the women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s houses; Lake Victoria has lots of hippos that can easily destroy the gardens if they were by the lake.  To protect the gardens from animals such as chickens, dogs, goats, and cows, we will put strong fences around the gardens.  _x000D_\n      Our volunteers have helped the women acquire basic business skills such as bookkeeping, and the women will be more than able to take care of their gardens.  To them, the gardens mean more than just crops such as pawpaws, tomatoes, and onions.  The gardens are the hopes that they themselves can take care of their children and provide them with adequate food, books, and other supplies for school.  The garden of hope will help them maximize their potentials that they haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t had any chances to utilize yet.  Moreover, the gardens will help the local community and its economy.  As an island, Rusinga offers a couple of economic activities such as fishing and farming, but only to a limited extent.  As mentioned earlier, Lake Victoria is way overfished; it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t have enough fish for all the fishermen and residents who need food, especially protein.  Our main diet consists of ugali, which is maize.  We consume a lot of carbohydrates, and our diet is not balanced with protein or other nutrition.  By growing and selling fresh, local crops such as pawpaws, tomatoes, and onions, the women will be able to offer the community a chance to eat balanced meals and become healthy.     _x000D_\n      The garden of hope will offer the women a sense of ownership: not only the ownership of the gardens, but also the ownership of their lives.  The garden will help them generate income and put food on their tables besides trading sex for fish.   The garden will help their children have a better chance of breaking the cycle of poverty.  Moreover, the garden will help the community eat more than just carbohydrates and eat balanced meals.  With the combination of our team\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s passion, the widows\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 determination and your fund, we will be able to make a positive change in the world._x000D_\n", "project_details": "This project takes place on Rusinga Island, an impoverished coastal area in Kenya.

At the end of the first year of operations, we will distribute the same survey, to the same women, to compare the responses, to see where the entrepreneurs are at in terms of operations.

But looking at the women status in education, health and employment, the indicators shows still there is need of lots of efforts to be made for women empowerment. The economic contribution of women is substantial, but largely unnoticed because their traditional role is taken for granted. In most rural areas, their employments outside the household generally are limited to planting, weeding, and harvesting. In urban areas, those migrating from rural areas or with a lower economic status are employed in domestic and traditional jobs, as well as in the government sector, mostly in low-level positions. The socio-economic status of women in Nepal is very poor. The women are being discriminated in every aspect of the society. In order to empower women lots of efforts have to be made. Managing solid waste is one of the major challenges in urbanization. A survey conducted in all 58 municipalities of Nepal in 2012 found that the average municipal solid waste generation was 317 grams per capita per day. This translates into 1,435 tons per day or 524,000 tons per year of municipal solid waste generation in Nepal. Many of these technically and financially constrained municipalities are still practicing roadside waste pickup from open piles and open dumping, creating major health risks. Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, lack of public awareness, and poor management by municipalities have intensified environmental problems in towns in Nepal, including unsanitary waste management and disposal. While solid waste management (SWM) has become a major concern for municipalities and the country as a whole.   _x000D_\nThe analysis of household waste composition indicated that the highest waste category was organic waste with 66%, followed by plastics with 12%, and paper and paper products with 9%. There is an identified key recommendation for solid waste management (SWM) in Nepal as enhancement of public participation and entrepreneur's development would be effective in advancing SWM practices._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn this regards entrepreneurship development targeting women and young girls can be much effective as it is clear from the data that lots of the waste categorized is household waste. Recycling of solid waste as a resource will reduce the amount of waste that needs to be disposed as well as the cost of waste management. Composting is a simple and effective way of recycling waste that is already being practiced. There are several different ways to compost waste this project will adopt vermi composting at the scale of household level directly benefiting women from perspective of knowledge, skill and economic growth._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Goal of the Project is 'To improve the living standard of Women and young girls through household Solid waste management (SWM) developing entrepreneurship.'_x000D_\nFirst of all there will be identified two municipalities in coordination with various Government and Non- Government organizations and through the secondary data review regarding the economic, social status of women.

After the selection of the wards there will be the conduction of the Scoping orientation programs to around 400 women that is approximately 20 women groups. The Scoping orientation program will focus on the overall activities that will be conducted along with the sharing on how they can be economically independent through Solid Waste Management.

This therefore will keep their lives revolving around unhealthy sexual behaviour and yet they could utilise the ICT entrepreneurial skills to manage their livelihoods as well as change their future.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAlthough there are a number of interventions for the CSWs in Kawempe division, there is need for more effort to help them raise their status from vulnerability to independence by acquiring employable skills. Many of the available interventions in this division have invested in traditional skills which have been associated with illiterate people or failures; in turn they have been shunned in favour of their usual risky activities for survival. This has failed to raise the status of young women involved and those at risk of being involved with time in the commercial sex work within Kawempe slums.

In addition, Cultural norms and traditional values of Nepalese society also promotes gender inequality in many ways. Women are always taken as somebody who will look after her husband, take care of him, give birth to his children, raise them and just spent her life maintaining the status of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093caretaker\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. Women lack access to various opportunities and service facilities. As a result- most of them are unemployed and are poor. Because of that- they don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t have any dignity in their own home and confined within the territory of their home and are often victims of domestic-violence._x000D_\nMoreover, if we look at the problems and challenges of women with disabilities- they are much more severe. In addition to the problems of general women that we discussed earlier, women with disabilities also experiences discrimination due to their physical or mental impairment. They are often considered as burden to the family and society and is not able to do any work that is important._x000D_\n_x000D_\nProject Introduction:_x000D_\nOur project- Learn to Earn will be one year long and will be divided in 3 quarters (4 months= 1 quarter).  In the first quarter we will select at least 35 women from central region of Nepal, preferably rural area and bring them to the capital city- Kathmandu. We will make sure that  at least 30%  of these participants are women with disabilities. Here, they will be provided five day residential extensive training on leadership and entrepreneurship skills. They will learn to be confident and believe in themselves.  Also they will be taught to understand what their interest is or express their business ideas. We will share the best business ideas among the participants and will give some time to come-up with their business idea and we will award the 4 best  ideas ( either in group or individual) and take over them for the second quarter of the project._x000D_\n._x000D_\nIn the second quarter, those 4 group of people or individual who were selected as best idea   will get specific training on their own business ideas and interests. For example if someone wants to start mushroom farming or Beekeeping- we will provide them training, workshops and business consultations related to that specific business idea they have. We will help them throughout the quarter to prepare business plan and other legal requirements they will need to start their business._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn our third and last quarter, our individuals or groups that were selected in the first quarter and received specific business training in the second quarter will be able to start their own business or social enterprise. Through our project we will provide them a small amount of non-refundable seed money to kick-start their project. But we will make sure that, these people will also contribute some share of the total cost so that- they will feel that are not just spending some project\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s money and feel ownership in what they are doing. With all the knowledge and skills they have now from the trainings and with the seed money provided by us; they will be able to start their business enterprise. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAfter their business is started we will monitor them and provide necessary guidance, feedbacks and consultation wherever necessary to make their business run smooth. Also this will be the same quarter where we finish up things by documenting the progress report in the form of photographs, audios and videos. We will do the final evaluation of the project and prepare the detailed report of our whole project._x000D_\n_x000D_\nResult:_x000D_\nEven though; our project will end in one year- the work we started will never end. It will be sustainable in itself. The project participants who are our beneficiaries will continuously work towards expanding their business. They will be able to hire other women as their employee and helpers. Their economic status will improve. They will be able to earn for their family. This will certainly change the traditional mindset of people to look towards women. Women will no longer be confined in their homes and now will be taken as a new force in the economic development of the society and the nation._x000D_\nOur project will also be able to empower women with disabilities. They will receive the same level of training and other facilities from our project. Thus they will also be able to start their own business. In our society, where a women with disability is looked as no more than useless burden on family- the results of our project will certainly bring about a revolutionary social change. Disabilities will no longer be looked as incompetence or inability. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAlso another achievement of this project will be able to bring women with and without disabilities together. In Nepal, persons with disabilities are always segregated from persons without disabilities because of physical and attitudinal barriers. Because of this people without disabilities are not always sensitive towards issues of person with disabilities like accessibility. But our project will bring both women with and without disability together in various activities. This will certainly help them to understand each other and work towards building inclusive society._x000D_\n_x000D_\nConclusion:_x000D_\nOur project \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Learn to Earn: Female Led Entrepreneurship Development Project \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093will aim to empower women with and without disabilities from rural part of Nepal economically and socially by providing them knowledge, skills and platform to start and run their own business enterprise.

We are also looking at individual groups leveraging on their social capital and organizational capacity to link up with agricultural development efforts, health and education. We are also looking to replicate this project in other parts of rural Cameroon. Replication of our project is relatively easy because the need of physical resources is minimal, reporting and accounting formats are easy to understand, internal activities are managed by group members and thus there is transparency and flexibility. Women groups are also largely homogenous with members sharing similar interest thus a peer incentive to help the women reach their goal of savings, repayment and reinvestment. There is also no technical requirement for reselling.\nWithin the short term, we are looking to ensure that the project goes self-sustainable within 4 months from the starting date.

Through an exposure to lending & accounting system, it will also help them understand basics of Micro lending and Banking.

The main idea of the project aimed initially to identify sources that can be easily found or produced in rural areas of Cameroon without technical requirements or additional costs to be implemented. Because of its favorable agriculture conditions Cameroon has a large potential and it plays an important role in its economy contributing today with more than 20% of its GDP. 70% of Cameroon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s workforce also is present in rural areas of the country. Poverty in the country is largely a rural phenomenon with 55% of the poor living in rural areas. Women population is another factor to be considered as 50% of the Cameroonian population is formed by women. Considering these factors \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c agriculture potential, poverty in rural areas, large population of women, high number of children dropping out of the school \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c we joined forces to build a project which aims to empower the women economically through entrepreneurial training allowing them to use agriculture resources, which are already available, and at the same time promoting an increment of quality of life and a reduction in the number of children dropping out of the school to engage in inadequate jobs for a low payment. _x000D_\nThe retail of palm oil is only one of the various agriculture products available in the community of Jinkfuin and we see a potential to develop entrepreneurial initiatives with other products like handicraft products, traditional fabrics, soap, candles and etc. After the Income Generation Project some women were able to implement a variety of products to be sold by the groups showing that the project can be easily replicate even when it includes a variation of the activity. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis is a self-sustainable project which will reach independence from external funding within its 4th month of operation. This is achieved through in-built elements of the project, as well as effective strategies for successful implementation of the project. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn-built elements include: despite the fact that input cost for first 4 months are covered by the grant money, women will get it at discounted rates to ensure a healthy financial status at group level. Interest earned on repayment of loan will grow principle amount and more interest is generated, money will grow at projected rate of 20%. There is also presence of democratic way of forming lending norms and peer influence, which will help in reducing defaults and ensuring timely payments. Administrative cost is maintained to be minimal. Women group can also leverage on their social capital to form linkages with formal lending institutions, civil societies and agricultural agencies for further diversification._x000D_\n_x000D_\nStrategies for implementation include: having norms and code of conduct regarding Financial and Social values, as well as terms and conditions for loan repayments which will be agreed upon and followed by members to create a more supportive and productive environment. Loan will be disbursed subject to member\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s majority approval. Leaders and GMM official will monitor the activities and ensure that all accounting adhere to the provided formats and that there is not much deviation in the figures from projected financial statement. This will ensure healthy numbers both at Group and Member level. Members can change the rules provided majority of women agree for it thus making it more flexible. Group size is small and is homogenous; women sharing the same vision and having commonality like staying in similar locality, having children studying in same school, etc are encouraged to be in same group, this will ensure a better implementation and transparency. Peer pressure will motivate women to save, invest more and repay on time.

In addition they received training on Rights and entitlements, leadership and peace building along with finance and accounts management. FST had received remarkable response from the women, and most of those who were trained are now emerging as entrepreneurs.

This district has a total population is 40,576;  20,126 females.  GCT focuses on 2 communes and 6 villages in this district.  Srey Ambel District is located in southeastern Koh Kong Province. The Khmer Rouge controlled the area until 1996 and families are known as KH defectors continue to live there.   Ecologically it is composed of tropical rain forests, higher altitude, pine forests, inundated lowland forests, mangroves, rice fields, streams, coastline and islands.  The district is rich in natural resources.  Its upland forests are virtually the sole source of cut firewood and charcoal \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c used in cooking.  Sawn timber, whole logs and charcoal are exported in Thailand and Malaysia.  Forests provide wood and livelihoods to many of Sre Ambel\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s people; however deforestation is occurring at such a rapid rate that it endangers not only the livelihoods of woodcutters but also the agricultural and marine based livelihoods of the district.  Soil erosion (aggravated by large \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c scale commercial cutting of forest concessions) is the major reason that farmers using slabs \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c and burn techniques in the upland forests abandon their farms after only two or three seasons.  The district\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s major river is already silted to the point that large boats find it difficult to reach the town, located only seven kilometers from the sea.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThousands of families of both migrants and long term residents supplement their farming incomes or make their total living by cutting wood directly from the province\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s forests.  The wood is sold in the form of whole logs, sawn timber, firewood, charcoal and poles.  Once a log is cut, it takes seven to ten days to bring it out of the mountains and to the saw mill or road where it can be sold. For at least two weeks of labor a woodcutter earns only five US dollars per log.  Logs of lesser quality are cut into small pieces, usually by women and children, and packaged for sale as firewood.  In order to eat, woodcutting families are increasingly forced to rely on cutting younger trees to make firewood and charcoal. As these trees are cut, there is less and less chance for the forests to continue growing to produce more wood for the future.  Responding to this challenge requires a number of strategies.  These could include traditional knowledge techniques, innovative technologies and new forms of social organization.  Taken together these approaches will provide viable alternatives for the villagers as they confront the new demands of making a living in an increasingly globalized environment._x000D_\n_x000D_\n", "project_details": "Through working with Commune Council for Women and Children  and Children and Women Council Committee women group, Genesis Community of Transformation Cambodia (GCT) would be able to build capacity of women in adapting climate change, improved women\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2s participation on decision making process, enhanced access to climate change information and active participation of women\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2s adaptation to climate change and creating sustainable income generating livelihood._x000D_\nWomen in rural areas in developing countries are highly dependent on local natural resources for their livelihood, because of their responsibility to secure water, food and energy for cooking and heating.

We have formed 17 groups of Women with Disabilities, one in each district with 11 members in every group. These are women who have no access to education, livelihood and government entitlements. They are discriminated in their own families, communities and society at large. With the triple discrimination of gender, disability and poverty, Women with Disabilities in these areas live a life of helplessness and disgrace._x000D_\nThe objective of forming such groups was empowerment of Women with Disabilites through education, advocacy and skill training, so that they live a life with dignity and respect. However, though the groups were formed, due to lack of resources the objective couldn't be achieved. At present, the groups are supporting its members through financial assistance by holding monthly meetings._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWith the financial grant from Project Inspire, NDWA will reach out to the women in all the 17 districts to achieve the said objective. In order to empower women, the groups will be legally registered as Disabled People's Organization (DPO), which will give authority to its members. The groups will be sensitized on disability and rights-based approach; will be trained on forming DPOs, functioning of DPOs, claim legal rights from government authorities and work for the development of Women with Disabilities in their respective districts. Further, the groups will receive leadership training and skill development training to enable them to live an independent life. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe believe that process of empowerment of women with disabilities begins with taking charge of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s personal strengths, and using it to achieve one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s personal goals. Empowerment lies in the acceptance of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s disability and limitations. Empowerment lies in not looking oneself as a victim but an agent of change for oneself and for others. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe project aims at supporting the Women With Disabilities groups to gain an appropriate perspective towards their disabilities and societal attitudes. Due to various cultural practices prevalent in Nepal, people with disabilities are looked down upon as a disgrace to the society, and are mostly isolated and rejected from participation in any kind of development activities. For Women with Disabilities, such discrimination takes a dual fold. In order to break the societal myths and to live a respectful life, Women With Disabilities will have to learn to look at themselves with pride and not as an object of pity, and at the same time educate the society about their rights and capabilities. This can be attained through constant interactions, dialogues, sharing and providing training to the Women With Disabilities groups._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFormation of DPOs is one of the core objectives of the project for which the Women With Disabilities groups will be provided adequate training. As a member of DPOs, Women With Disabilities will be at a position to legally claim their entitlements from government and advocate for their rights. And as a responsibility of a DPOs the benefits will not just remain with its members, but will eventually reach to every other Women With Disabilities in their respective districts. In order to attain this, the groups will receive extensive training on leadership, rights and entitlements and administration. The groups will be empowered to not only assert their rights but to further empower other Women With Disabilities in their districts, generating more leaders. This will eventually lead the empowerment process to produce multiple effects._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOnce the groups have gained the rights-based attitude and leadership in them, to further enhance their independence, economic empowerment will be a vital step which will make a huge impact on the lives of Women with Disabilities. The groups will receive training on entrepreneurship and business literacy. The groups will initiate entrepreneurial projects in their respective districts and ensure participation of as many Women with Disabilities as possible. The groups will be taught basics in micro financing, enterprise management and financial management. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nHence, through the process of revealing one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s potentials, giving voice to their opinions, participating in society to advocating for individual and collective rights of Women with Disabilities, to attaining economic independence, Women with Disabilities will be justly empowered in the society.

Their lack of vocational skills and stigma from time in prisons compounds their financial and emotional struggles as they find themselves in the very conditions that often led to crime, condemning them to a cycle of poverty and crime.

The first is to cover production costs such as costume hire, performance hall rent and lighting costs, sound design and orchestration, and video projector costs, as we increase the number and size of shows performed. Touch World has already grown from one to three correctional facilities in West Bengal, India, and the inmates have put up 90 shows across India in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata, performing in prestigious art and dance festivals.

If the families cannot be located, or refuse to take the woman back, IswarSankalpa will make other provisions for the safe relocation of such cases in institutions or to integrate them back in the community. In case of reintegration with the family, the family members will be counselled about the state of the restored woman.

Past projects have focused on attempts to build a school serving children living in IDP camps in Mogadishu and providing support services for victims of sexual assault. _x000D_\nOur current project is entitled Somachange, and seeks to simultaneously strengthen the economy and education access in Mogadishu through an innovative approach to microfinance. In the summer of 2013, Filsan Darman, the founder of Aadamiga, went to Somalia and asked groups of impoverished female entrepreneurs to identify their primary professional challenges. Their responses indicate that, though their businesses were active and moderately successful, lack of access to initial capital and training was inhibiting their business growth and preventing them from increasing their profits. As a result, many female entrepreneurs employed their children, particularly their daughters, in order to reduce their overhead. These assets are readily available to business owners in more developed nations, and are considered necessary for entrepreneurs of all backgrounds and skill levels to be successful. Our aim is to fill this gap in the local economic infrastructure in order to help jump-start a struggling region. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe intend to offer small loans to mothers in Mogadishu who are currently operating small businesses. In addition to capital, these women will be offered business courses aimed at teaching them basic bookkeeping skills and business methodology.

We will initially make small loans to five Somali women, identified by Aadamiga as currently active and potentially successful business owners with school-age children who lack only the resources we intend to provide. Our resources will be allocated to the following expenditures. We will be hiring two full-time employees who will be charged with identifying viable loan candidates, training recipients in business methodology, ensuring the proper usage of loans and compliance with terms, collecting payment, record-keeping, and general management. We will be investing in high-quality training materials for our business courses.

They will be identified in the community by opinion leaders and peer educators and will be enrolled for practical skills training in making soil bricks also known as stabilised compressed earth blocks which will allow the girls to easily manufacture high quality bricks and as a result, they will receive a high income for themselves and their children. Stabilised soil bricks technology offers a cost effective, environmentally sound masonry system. It is manufactured by compacting earth (murrum/sub soil) mixed with a stabilizer such as cement or lime and has a wide application in construction. The girls will be availed with a number of manual machines which compact the readily available soil to attain dense, even sized masonry. The bricks are then laid out in the sun and cured rather than being fired.  There is a high growing demand for construction bricks in Uganda since this is a quickly growing sector of the economy yet almost all forests have been encroached propelling government to enact strict regulations on cutting down trees. This trend has resulted in fired bricks becoming expensive to be afforded creating opportunity for this low cost new invention which applies environmentally friendly local technology. After a successful completion of the course, the young mothers will be encouraged to form groups of 5s and further be trained in business proposal writing and small business management skills as well as saving, thereafter, they will be asked to submit proposals which will be funded under the revolving fund scheme and each group will supervise its members.

To achieve this goal, one area of focus was on Cambodian women's empowerment (Neary Rattanak) and the implementation of the National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women. However, the body of law needs strengthening and it alone is not suffice. For instance, Cambodian Gender Assessment Survey 2008 (Ministry of Women's Affairs-MOWA) indicated that nearly a quarter of Cambodian women suffered from some form of violence and most perceive domestic violence as the norm. Despite the seemingly low reported cases, violence against women (VAW) is prevalent across Cambodia. Results from such gender based violence research only provides a glimpse of the reality of a woman's life in Cambodia. Violence Against Women Base Line Survey (2005) found that only 11% of victims of violence seek assistance or justice. _x000D_\nIn order to have a social impact and increase in the quality of life for Cambodian women it is necessary to change the attitudes and perception of violence against women from being socially accepted. This project aims to use information and communication technologies (ICT) as the catalyst to reduce violence against women by focusing on female adolescents as social change agents and advocates for women's rights in Cambodia. How can female adolescents effectively share their stories of being victims of violence? How can we increase female adolescents' voice on women's rights and equality in the media? _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe goal of the project is breaking women silence on VAW by strategic use of ICT._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe objectives of the project is twofold:_x000D_\n1) The use of ICT for ending violence against women (eVAW) by women&girls will be strengthened_x000D_\n2) Women&Girls voices asking for eVAW be increased and heard_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe project will be comprised of two components: 1) Training, and 2) Advocacy campaign._x000D_\n_x000D_\nTarget group: Direct target group 460 mostly Young women and girls from \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093 Young Women Leadership\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d and from Green Youth Association from 30 Universities in Phnom Penh, Battambang and Siem Reap province.

The objective of each training session will focus on how to use Internet tools for emailing, researching, writing, and disseminating information openly and effectively on issues raised around violence against women. Participants will be introduced on how to use various social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogging), and effective internet posting approaches such as for newspaper articles or video recordings. For example, blogging provides a platform for women to become active advocates and disseminator of knowledge on violence against women, sharing their personal stories and supporting victims of violence. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThree ICT training courses on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Female Adolescents Using ICT for eVAW\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d will be held once in November 2013,  and January 2014,  with a total of 60 female adolescents participation.

", "project_details": "According to the latest survey by OI, 3841 cases were reported in 2011 as gender based violence (GBV) in Cambodia, with most of the cases reported by women as being victims of violence. Similarly, other reports indicated 15-25% of Cambodian women are beaten by their spouse (WGRC, 1994). Victims of violence are faced with several adversity in acquiring justice such as the social tolerance for women mistreatment, weak justice system for victims of violence, few safe places to voice incidents of GBV, and limited access to increase awareness on VAW._x000D_\nIn spite of an active and strong female adolescents 's presence in ending violence against women in Cambodia, most lack the knowledge and skills on how to express their voice on women 's rights.

The program will operate from Githurai. It will target girls, who due to their poor background, are an able to proceed to college. Such girls turn to menial jobs which are at times demeaning. The project will aim to reach 100 girls annually. Due to the fact that income from sales of apps and animation products may not be immediate, the project will also have an agribusiness venture. This will include a rabbit rearing unit. Rabbits have a ready market in Kenya. Further, their gestation period is short and they do not require a lot of space. This business will keep the program going until we can get income from apps and animations. The program will also include financial literacy training which will be conducted by Kingdom Sacco, a financial Institution which has served the residents of Githurai for about two decades. This will allow the girls to be better managers of their finances. There will also be a mentoring program that will link the girls with elder people who have succeeded in the areas of agribusiness or app development and animation. It is envisioned that after going through the program, the girls will be able to develop apps, or animate or start their own agribusiness. strategy_x000D_\nICT training_x000D_\nSCI has already established and built a relationship with a consultant  company called Nett consultants . Nett Consultants  and its consultants have won several awards in the app making arena in Kenya. Nett has also participated in other training initiatives including training parents and teachers from Githurai in making animations for their children. We plan to utilize his experience in ICT and working with communities and especially in Githurai. The training will be on two areas. These will be in mobile app development and animation. _x000D_\nThe mobile apps developed will be sold online to enable the girls to fetch income. A useful app will fetch an average of 1 USD per download. The number of Kenyans accessing the Internet has grown five-fold to 19.2 million users as at September 2013, according to data from the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK). The internet penetration has thus risen to 47%. This has created a great demand for ICT products including apps and animations. _x000D_\nThe other area will be animation. In this, the girls will we trained in making cartoons and advertisements based on animated characters. They will first be trained on Crazy Talk, first in 2D and then later in 3D. We envision that after the program has been running for a while, we shall be able to sell cartoon shows to be aired on TV._x000D_\nBoth the training in animation and mobile app development will be done in modules. The trainees will have to pass in one module to go on to the next. By the end of the training, a cohort of trainees will have acquired enough skills to be able to either make mobile apps or animation._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFinancial literacy training_x000D_\nAlongside the ICT skills that the girls will learn, there will be financial literacy skills. This stems from our belief that resources make little difference unless they are managed well. The financial literacy skills will be taught in partnership with Kingdom Sacco Ltd. Ksacco is a fiancial institution that has served the residents of Githurai for almost 20 years. Kingdom Sacco has previously engaged in training youths in fincial literacy, and thus, have the capacity and resources. _x000D_\nAs part of the training, each trainee will be given an account with KSACCO. No money will be charged on opening the account and no minimum balance will be required. They will also be issued with a piggy bank to help develop a saving culture. This accounts will later be used to acquire loans from Kingdom Sacco. _x000D_\nIncome generation_x000D_\nWe acknowledge that the ICT training cannot act as an immediate source of income. Further, as a nation, we have challenges in food security. In response to these problems, the trainees will be trained on rabbit keeping and sack farming. Through other initiatives that SCI has worked with such as Horeb Youth Group, we have identified community resource person who are willing to train any person willing to start rabbit farming. These two activities are not resource intensive and are easy to learn. Rabbit keeping involves rearing of rabbits in batteries for commercial purposes. Rabbits require little space since an area of two square feet can hold nine rabbits; 3 cages on top of each other each holding three rabbits. Feeding of rabbits is also easy since for the bigger part, they will be fed of foliage which will be collected from the surrounding. There is a ready market for rabbit meat. Each kilo of meat fetches between USD 4 and USD 7. The rabbits can either be sold live or slaughtered. They will be the main immediate source of income. Sack farming involves planting vegetables in sacks filled with soil. The sacks can be placed near verandahs, hanged from the walls of the house and placed in corners near a house. The vegetables will provide food to the trainees and the surplus will be sold to earn an income. _x000D_\nMentorship_x000D_\nIn our more than 10 years of operations among the youth we have identified mentorship as one of the most effective tools in social transformation. Information is not adequate to change an individual. Due to this, we usually link our target youths will other older people to help them navigate through different stages in life. We envision that the trainees will be linked with other women working in the areas of ICT to allow them to have a broader perspective of the activities and also to motivate them beyond the initial challenges. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAbout USD 4,000 will be used in establishing a rabbit rearing unit. about USD 7,000 will be used in the purchase of computers, about 3,000 will be used in the renting, maintenance of a training facility/class, repairs and utilities, about USD 7,000 will be used in training and development in the areas of mobile app development and animation.

So they can get about $1 606 500  in 7months. They get all of this without any investment. Any time we install a machine women from villages surrounding about 150km come and use the machine because of the high income.

In April 2012 a micro-credit system for poor women in the villages concerned was set up with the slogan 'You can get everything if you can pay in kernel'. This credit allows them to buy palm bunches which are then converted into palm oil they sell to improve their lives. With 5,5 Euros micro credit 50 liters of palm oil with a value of 50 Euros can be produced. They repay the credit by providing the seed kernel that was once thrown away. In January 2013 a pressing machine was crafted and further farm tools like palm oil press decanter, winnower, crusher etc.  In April 2013, an industrial extraction unit was installed to encourage palm growers and also to facilitate rural women's work. The machine piles, presses, washes and drains palm fibers completely. It can press up to 70 barrels per day with a much higher yield. It just takes 10 minutes to fill the press with seeds. Its capacity is superior to those imported from China. The increased oil yield has significantly increased the income.

Maternal mortality rate is now 224 deaths per 100,000 live births. In sub-Saharan Africa, 34.8 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per 100 000 women annually, and 22.5 per 100 000 women die from the disease. Cancer incidence rate is higher in some other Western countries, compared to African countries; but, more women die of cancer in African countries than in the Western countries. For instance, in western Europe, breast cancer incidence is higher with 90 new cases per 100 000 women annually, compared with 30 per 100 000 in eastern Africa. In contrast, breast cancer deaths are almost identical, at about 15 per 100 000, which clearly points that later diagnosis and much poorer survival in eastern Africa, despite lower incidence rate.

Not only that problems, sometimes small industries do not want to dump their jelantah oil because they think they will be damaged if they do that, so another way they take are sell it to retailer. I am also very sad to see that action because we know that jelantah oil very dangerous for our health if it used again. Another problems are because there many people in my city who are unempolyment and also banana peel like kepok banana peel if we just dump it will causing the greenhouse gases.

Transfedha/Wings of Hope supports the women with knowledge and creativity in how to make a small business successful, and offers flexibility in various repayment processes. We make loan repayment and saving easier through the use of mobile technology. Transfedha/Wings of Hope is also holistic in its support of the family, offering education loans for children, medical loans and opportunities to buy into medical, business and property insurance. In 2014, over 1,000 women have joined Transfedha/Wings of Hope to date._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project grows out of two premises. First, women are the primary providers in Kenya because many men are forced through high local unemployment to seek jobs as migrant laborers. Therefore women, not men, often shoulder the burden of providing food, shelter, clothing, education and healthcare to their families. Second, the solution to poverty lies in enabling people to generate an income through their own sweat and energies. The providing of loans is the final element of building a generation of responsible citizens capable of improving their state in life. Independence is fostered rather than dependency. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur field-tested objectives and strategies include: 1) Identify, recruit and train women entrepreneurs on successfully running a small business; 2) Offer affordable microloans and encourage self-reliance through flexible repayment schedules; 3) Encourage saving and offer supplemental products such as education loans for children and medical loans to offset family healthcare expenses; 4) Train entrepreneurs to use technology to support their business operations; 5) Promote gender equity by offering equal employment opportunities within Transfedha/Wings of Hope. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nProject leaders further these objectives through a number of supporting strategies, one of which is encouraging women who currently work as wage employees to create their own businesses. These women spend their time doing hard labor for minimal pay that does not sustain their families.

Transfedha/Wings of Hope\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s strategy of offering small loans at low rates achieves two ends.

Secondly, the interest income offsets Transfedha\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s costs of lending and allows for slow, sustainable growth._x000D_\n_x000D_\nTransfedha/Wings of Hope launched its pilot phase in 2013 in Bomet, a mid-size town in the Kenyan countryside, with the intent of eventually offering its services to all rural areas of Kenya.

We learned how to use tools, to mix cement mortar, to lay bricks, to cut holes through our roofs, to install and maintain stoves.

For this project, the most obvious evidence to verify success is the level of confidence in the women who will participate in the internship program. Their self-worth will present itself. More tangible evidence would be political movements. Including deafness as part of the national census, or at least conducting a sample study would show some evidence of bringing awareness to this cause. Finally, the caliber of backers of the crowd funding project will show to some degree, the level of awareness and support received for the cause. The numerical value of viewers of the television network and Youtube will also serve as a good indicator for creating global awareness. Perhaps the most ambitious source of evidence would be for the government of Korea to be moved by this initiative, and turn their efforts to not only empowerment of women, but peacemaking with North Korea.

The organization seeks to enlighten the women in such communities on menstruation, teenager and growing girls on puberty and provide the school going girls of puberty age the sanitary towels to ensure they keep in school even during their menstrual flow. The organization further seeks to support such schools girls from poor social economic background with annual packs of sanitary towels in a way that they shall never drop out of school anytime with a reason tag \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c menstrual flow or lack of sanitary towels.  _x000D_\nAccording to APHRC (2010), Limited access to safe affordable, convenient and culturally appropriate methods for dealing with menstruation has far reaching implications for rights and physical, social and mental well-being of many women and adolescent girls in Kenya. It undermines sexual and reproductive health and well-being and has been shown to restrict access to education. UNESCO estimates that one in 10 African adolescent girls miss school during menses and eventually drop out because of menstruation-related issues, such as the inaccessibility of affordable sanitary protection, the social taboos related to menstruation, and the culture of silence that surrounds it (All Africa, 2011).  According to UNICEF, (2005), one in ten schoolgirls in Africa miss classes or drop out completely due to their period, and substitute pads or tampons for less safe and less absorbent materials such as rags, newspaper or bark. _x000D_\nIn the Kenyan scenario, a study conducted by the Federation of African Women Educationists (FAWE) in 2010 found that about 500,000 Kenyan girls miss school every month because they cannot afford sanitary towels. The major concern for Kenya as a pioneer country in east Africa for free and compulsory primary education (FPE) eight years ago is the challenge of high enrolment. This has been too challenging that it has started eating up the achievement gained in the free primary education (FPE) which was aimed at enrolling high number of children in the school system. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAcknowledging the threat that lack of sanitary towel pose to the girl child education in Kenya, the government rolled out a programme to provide and distribute sanitary towels to the girls in primary and secondary schools in Kenya as a matter of necessity in FPE. According to the Kenya\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s ministry of education, the government allocated Ksh. 240 Million in the Financial Year 2011/2012 for provision of sanitary towels. This was targeted to benefit 443,858 girls in public primary drawn from 82 targeted districts. However, this allocation is not adequate to meet needs of the 2.6 million girls in primary and secondary schools. Kenya has got 254 districts as of July 2009; the target of 82 districts only, means provision of Sanitary towels to only 32% of the primary schools in the whole Nation. The Ministry of education further stated that the funds provided by the government will only be able to help primary schools in the targeted 82 districts. This implies that secondary schools in the said districts will never attain any help from the government provisions. This also does not factor in those others schools that fall in the untargeted 172 districts. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe biggest challenge to the Government provision is that it is lacking by 91% to ensure a full rollout of the programme. This is because; the programme requires 2.6 Billion shillings and the Government provided only Kshs. 240 Million shillings which is only 9% of the required amount of money. The Government programme does not cater for the Puberty education that is also very essential for the communities where these teenagers are coming from. This implies that if no other measures are taken, then the rate of school dropout by the teenagers and girls in their puberty age will still remain or even increase due to lack of knowledge, help or sanitary towels. This therefore prompts Mfariji Africa to act through Sanitary Sanity Campaign rather than wait and watch the young girls suffer due to lack of sanitary towels. The fact is that the organization can never make to rollout the whole programme satisfactorily, but with the necessary support, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s optimistic that they can make a change to the marginalized school going girls, disadvantaged and to those from poor social economic background._x000D_\nSo far in our previous sanitary towels distributions projects, we have been receiving support from local friends, families, well wishers, churches, individual entrepreneurs, few corporate institutions and also personal volunteers. We thank them all for their concern, commitment and generous support to the girls who without them would not be in school due to lack of sanitary towels or could be missing their classes during their menstrual periods. _x000D_\nAs you can see from the proposed overall budget of 25,000 USD Sanitary Sanity Campaign (SSC) is not including most of the personnel labour and technical managerial experts as they have got Volunteer members who by offering their services have significantly lowered this budget to ensure 500,000 girls are reached. _x000D_\nBelieve me, in Sanitary Sanity Campaign (SSC), a sum like this will do wonders for the traumatized, suffering girls who are enduring atrocious living conditions now.

Even in the most globalized and socially advance societies of today, complacency and neglect has taken at toll on millions. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 5% or 360 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss, and 33% of seniors over 65 are impaired. Nearly half of hearing losses are avoidable through primary prevention, and for those impaired, current production of hearing aids supply less than 10% of the global need. Of these 360 million people, women are marginalized to the greatest extent._x000D_\nCurrent solution of providing hearing aids is limited in its scope and brings only temporary relief. Rather, we will be addressing the root of the problem. Now is especially an apt time to launch our project \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Fair Women Fair World\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, because of the synergy we expect from global attention. Most recent example is the private advisory group composed of prominent individuals - like the CEO of McKinsey & Company - in conjunction with the UN Women Committee. Fair Women Fair World will directly affect 1.5 million people within the next 5 years through the empowerment marginalized women (especially women who are deaf), preventing hearing loss, creating global awareness, and starting a peace initiative in its domestic country: Creating a Fair World with Fair Women._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project will take place in South and North Korea for reasons of efficiency, urgency, and sustainment. Because of our existing partnership with South Korean companies (specifically catered for the deaf) in addition to our manufacturing facility established in China, North and South Korea is an ideal and efficient place for the launch. Moreover, this is an urgent issue for both countries. North Korea is one of the most politically reproached regimes. While developing countries like Botswana often evoke sympathy, North Korea evokes hostility. Thus humanitarian aids are limited \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c even legally - and are one-time events at best. Lack of infrastructure and aid with their patriarchic culture puts women, in dismay. Its neighbor to the South is on par. South Korea, despite the fact it is a socially advanced country, women (and especially those who are deaf) are mistreated severely. The most notable case is the sexual assault case of 9 deaf-mute students from 2000-2003 in Gwangju Inhwa School. These girls were raped multiple times by their teachers including the principal until the incident was reported by a newly appointed teacher. As such, silenced victims exist even in the most socially advanced societies. Our objective is to make lasting changes. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe can start making this difference with the help of Project Inspire. Fair Women Fair World implementation is divided into three tiers: short-term, mid-term and long-term. In the short term, we are planning to launch a 10 week internship program in partnership with Delight Co. for women who are deaf. Starting with 3-day training with audiologists and current employees, these women will be equipped to help build hearing aids. Every three months from then, 20 hearing aids will be sent to North Korean children. Only hearing aids to children will be provided because of legal issues surrounding seize fire. Furthermore, children, will be able to receive public education if they receive hearing aids before the age of 3, making them the prime target in order to break the cycle of poverty in North Korea. Deaf women will personally lead the change because the deaf have more in common than the average citizens of each country \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c the culture of deafness. Closer to the end of the internship, the media (TBS, who has done a similar feature of a deaf female Starbucks worker, or KBS if possible) will be contacted to capture the change in these women, and what these women stand for. By using the media, we want to let everyone see these marginalized women change the world. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn the mid-term, the increased attention created by the media will allow these women to be full-time employees. Additionally, the usual one-time gift of hearing aids to North Korea will be a sustained donation as profits from these women, as well as sponsorship from Solar Ear. Our ambitious project is to open a DREET Center (Detection, Research, Education, Equipment, Training) in both South and North Korea. Detection: free hearing test facility, Research: hearing-impaired demography, Education: prevention education, Equipment: Solar rechargers & hearing aid manufacturing, Training: sign language & hearing aid user guide. To reiterate, nearly half of hearing loss can be prevented. DREET will have $3500 allocated initially, and additional funds will be raised through crowd funding and microfinance. With our network of experts in the field including university professors, this strategy has an optimistic outlook. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn the long-term, the entirety of the project will be featured by the media for a second time to show the peace initiative shown by the most marginalized population. Once silenced people will have a chance to speak, and be the source of inspiration. With that momentum, and publicity, and help of other organizations like the public advisory for women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s rights, we will replicate this initiative all over the world. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOur mission is not to only provide hearing aids \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s to change the world. We have already successfully educated deaf men and women about HIV AIDS in Botswana, and the rate was lowered from 38% to 10% in the deaf population. Deaf youth of Botswana went to Brazil and trained new employees to empower them. In Brazil we offer auditory, speech language and voice therapy for free to over 6,000 children a year in Sao Paul. In Botswana, employees started at minimum wage, and now make 6-8 times the minimum. We have already implemented projects with great success, and our mission this time is to let the world hear the sounds of peace: Creating a Fair World, with Fair Women_x000D_\n", "project_details": "Every day, 360 million people are denied their human rights; 360 million people don\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2t a voice.

Though efforts have been made, still many people i.e. women, girls, elderly, people living with HIV and people with disabilities do not receive adequate information and support on  empowerment to uplift their quality of life and wellbeing based on social economic growth and improvement. _x000D_\nStudies conducted by the organization in some selected communities of Karonga District like Iponga, Wiliro, Nyungwe, Uliwa, Khwawa, Mlare, Kaporo, Songwe and Fuliwa indicated that the poor and marginalised such as women and girls are lacking the technical know-how to handle and run business and concerted efforts to uplift their lives, and Financial support to enable girls pursue with education in their respective communities. These studies targeted women and youth with the aim of tracking knowledge of rural citizens on democratic decentralization processes and women empowerment. The studies involved two hundred fifty three students in twenty five secondary schools in all five Traditional Authorities in the district. These studies revealed that women and girls are lacking skills of business management to reach at higher accelerate their lives economically. This retards economic growth and district development because the majority of women and girls are not illiterate on how to balance their business to meet their needs. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe most significant cause of the problem is income generating capacity and financial support to run their business properly and financial capital to accelerate their business which occurs because of gender differences and bad cultural practices. The other core problem is lack of initiatives by civil society organizations that help to facilitate enhancement of influencing policy strategies of gender equality, equity, women empowerment and girl retention to education as way of improving their concerted efforts in business management and education pursuit. Disadvantaged women and girls are used to as employees of men to sell their commodities in the district. This has been a challenge to Karonga women and girls as they have consequently been at low level of education to the part of girls and low economic development to the part of women for them to be self-reliant. Such situations intimidate women and girls as marginalised groups to act on issues affecting their lives socially and economically due to lack of interaction and dialogue between and amongst the innovators, non-state actors and women themselves when making decisions on economic development. This remains a challenge for women to accelerate their businesses for more women to reach at high level of economic development in the district. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn addition, inadequate access to information financial resources is also a challenge for the marginalised and discriminated groups of people because implementers are providing information which is not user-friendly when implementing interventions in rural communities. This prevents the people from taking part in issues affecting their lives socially and economically because they do not understand their roles in the socio \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c economic development activities. As a result, it is difficult for them to have any tangible impact on helping to women empowerment in developing the country. This state of ignorance on the part of the community merely retards local and district development economically._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA key factor in creating conducive environment for women and girls is the existence of equitable economic opportunities in development at local and national levels. Equitable economic opportunities availed to all groups of people is important as it increases greater social inclusion in the development of the individual, district as well as country. This ensures that government utilises local and national wealth for the benefit of all Malawians. In this regard, it is imperative that women and girls are fully empowered to uplift their lives economically. However, the foregoing paragraph highlights some gaps that include lack of women involvement in economic development gaps, linking gaps between funders and disadvantaged women._x000D_\n _x000D_\nIn view of the identified gaps, Karonga Debate Club (KADEC) intends to implement interventions that are designed to increase information sharing, capacity building and links in business management. KADEC will work with existing structures including volunteers, entrepreneurs and women with an aim of enhancing increased disadvantaged women investments. It is believed that this shall contribute to increased disadvantaged women engagement business operation to uplift their lives through capacity and financial support. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe project will undertake a series of trainings of women and girls who are the most disadvantaged in business management and empowerment, conduct public meetings that will carry messages of giving chance to disadvantaged women to keep themselves busy with stable businesses and support them with financial capital developing of pass goat project, mat making and selling rice for them to sustain their lives comfortably, and girls to learn without fear for furtherance of education. It will also lobby private sectors to link with these business women for them be business oriented. Similarly, girls will also be empowered and supported with school fees for them to pursue with education. It is assumed that through these interventions, women and girls will acquire knowledge and understanding of proper management of business which will enable them live a good and stable life. The proposed project shall conduct trainings, and distribution of IEC materials.

The project will  improve the economic livelihood of young women and girls affected and infected with HIV to harness their socio-economic potential and increase self-employment opportunities and income levels._x000D_\nNacwola's operations on the ground closely reflect this purpose.  A key strand of our strategic plan is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093enabling an environment for social protection and social transformation of poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d NACWOLA believes that socio-economic empowerment is key to poverty eradication, self-sustainability and financial and social independence. Our projects reflect this belief closely and therefore we have extensive experience of implementing these types of projects_x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nNacwola has direct experience of planning and implementing projects such as this. All over Uganda NACWOLA run projects that facilitate economic empowerment and self-sustainability amongst highly marginalised groups. For example, in Ndejje, the district NACWOLA group run a project making jewellery from recycled paper to sell locally. From a small initial investment, providing for training and start up costs these women have been able to successfully create a sustainable business. This had led to economic security for some 30 young women anf girls who collectively manage time, resources and their own bank account. NACWOLA has been able to add value to this project by introducing the women to international buyers who are able to sell the jewellery at a highly increased price in the UK maximizing profit and therefore return on investment. In the last 12 months the groups have made 8,000,000 UGX, with a net profit of 1,500,000UGX since the project began in 2012. This reflects both the objectives and the operational model for the Youth Livelihood Programme. While the group is self governing and self-sustaining NACWOLA engages in detailed monitoring and evaluation procedures, again closely mirroring the operational model for the Youth Livelihood Programme._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThrough 20 years of experience NACWOLA has found that with a relatively small initial investment groups with the right training and support are able to establish self-sustaining IGA's relatively quickly. In 22 district groups are engaged in bag making activities. For a small intital investment of 2,500,000 UGX NACWOLA was able to train 20 women to make and sell bags locally. This project again is now self-sustaining and has provided economic stability and increased income for more than 80 women in the district. Similarly to the jewellery making project in Ndejje._x000D_\nNACWOLA believes that economic independence and self empowerment is key to fight stigma and discrimination and eradicating poverty. All of the training we provide in our projects not only focuses on practical, marketable skills but also on life skills, budgeting, team working and entrepreneurship. For example, our \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Growing Together\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d project in Bugiri trained a number of women in agriculture including high value crops. However, as part of their training these women were taught book-keeping and record-keeping, accounting and how to maximize return by investing in seed for high demand produce. While this project is still in its pilot phase it has been a great success. After only 3 months the project is beginning to be self-sustaining, the women are harvesting and selling food produce at market and are reinvesting in high value crops that are responsive to the demand in their local area. These women were also trained to train others. This maximises return on investment as the original 5 women who were trained have trained others how to farm the land and the whole group is now working together. Further, the original 5 trainees were democratically elected from the district group reflecting a key process from the Youth Livelihood Programme's operational model._x000D_\n_x000D_\nNACWOLA'S message is one of hope and positive action to improve one's own livelihood. We believe that empowering marginalized groups to be self-sufficient and economically independent instills a strong work ethic amongst these groups and encourages people to work for themselves. The Ndejje jewellery making project has reported that all women involved have experienced positive attitudinal change. They have reported that the success of their business has boosted their morale and encouraged them to work even harder to provide jewellery for both their local and their international buyers. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOperating Principles:_x000D_\n_x000D_\nNACWOLA\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s  operational model already  reflects the operating principles of the YLP. Thus we are ideally placed to help implement this project. All our projects are demand driven and are conceptualized in conjunction with our district groups and are therefore responsive to need and innovation instead of dictating form from a centralized position. For example, the Bugiri farming pilot has developed to such a level that they are diversifying into poultry and egg production. As the group has made such a success of the farming project NACWOLA is currently helping them to plan and cost the poultry project. Therefore NACWOLA can prove that we have extensive experience of demand driven projects with active participation and ownership. As a women's organization we are ideally placed to ensure gender responsiveness in the overall YLP. Furthermore our countrywide network of district based groups\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 means that we can ensure equitable geographic distribution amongst local groups that are already highly engaged.

To sustain the impact COOP46 Team has develop a business toolkit that uses mobile phone platform to send lectures in bits to these women. The project will last for 10 months and will involve USD$ 24,835.GRAND PREPARATION_x000D_\nThe first one month will be used for grand preparation. The Team will start by identifying local businesses managed by the women in these communities that could be developed into larger industries in each of the 23 LGA of the State (Rivers State (RS))._x000D_\nThe Team will then get the endorsement of the RS government through four of the state ministries: Rivers State Ministry of Women Affairs, Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Rivers State Local Government Service Commission, and Rivers State Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Ministry of Women Affairs will help appoint 23 liaison officers, women leaders in the local community, one for each community. The Team will train these liaison officers for one week before the pilot phase starts. The RS government through these Ministries will mandate certain businesses operating in the State to buy their raw materials locally, especially from these COOP46 industries. The LGA will support the women (Participants) by providing conducive environment and support networks to assist the women in the setup process._x000D_\nCOOP46 will establish relationship with Microfinance Banks (MFB) in the State to provide loans to the cooperatives that will be formed. COOP46 Team has developed a business toolkit that operates on any simple mobile phone using voice and text to daily send business tips to these women, and to help them easily communicate, network and get direct instruction/support from the Team._x000D_\nPILOT PHASE_x000D_\nCOOP46 will use the next six months to visit the 23 LGA in RS. Four LGA will be visited per month. One LGA will be visited per week. The Team will visit one LGA per time. In each LGA, two cooperatives will be formed each with a startup capacity of 20 women. Based on the success of this pilot phase the number will be increased to 50 women._x000D_\nCOOP46 Team will have a training for about 100 women for each LGA. 40 of these participants will be selected and divided into 2 cooperatives, each having a 20 member capacity. The grouping criteria will include business interest, relevant skill and family location._x000D_\nTRAINING PERIOD_x000D_\nThe training period is five days. _x000D_\nDay 1 includes arrival of the Team, visit to the LGA chairman and the village head of the community. _x000D_\nDay 2 the first part of the training will include an introductory section about COOP46, aim and objective, the Team, Project Inspire and its objectives, the Project implementation plan, the expected results, the partnering organizations and the need for cooperative development. The schedule for the training will be preset by the women based on a day and time that is convenient with them. The training will be in 4 sections. Each section will be for a topic. One hour will be added for break and refreshment. The time breakdown for the training is 30minutes teaching, 15minutes group work/case studies/exercises, 15minutes questions and answers section. The training language is local English. The 4 topics for the training include (1) Opportunities and the need for locally driven sustenance. (2) Marketing/Customer Service. (3) Operations/Quality Control. (4) Finance/Management._x000D_\nThe women will be trained mostly on how to produce and sell in large quantities (1) palm kernel and its related derivatives to industries that are into cream making, soap making, (2) packaging of dried sea foods, (3) poultry products for restaurants etc, and other products based on availability in the community.  The cooperatives will be designed such that the startup capital will be very small since most of the women may already be operating these businesses individually. The aim of the cooperative is to help them bring their resources together to serve a larger market, and have access to funds to develop bigger corporations._x000D_\nDay 3 training will include the benefits of cooperatives, how to setup, manage and sustain cooperative based businesses, the individual, group and community benefits. The women will be more interested when they discover that forming and joining a cooperative will benefit financially and will be a means of employment for their children, the youths. The MFB will introduce the banking system and the lending modalities. The Team and the MFB will use the third section to help the participants form the 2 cooperatives needed. Leaders of the cooperatives will also be appointed. The COOP46 Team will use the fourth section to introduce the phone based business toolkit, and how the women can use it to increase their knowledge. For example, they will be taught how to use their phones to prepare their financial statement. Each participant will get daily business techniques daily for 3 months after the training._x000D_\nDay 4 is the graduation ceremony and visit of the participants to the setup location for their industries._x000D_\nDay 5 is departure, but first the Team will visit the community leaders to inform them of the success of the Project and to appreciate their support, and also intimate them on next action._x000D_\nMONITORING/EVALUATION/REPORTING _x000D_\nThe team will prepare its first report and submit the sixth day. Each cooperative formed will be mandated to setup and startup within one month after the training. _x000D_\nThe evaluation period is three months. A member of staff of COREHEAD will evaluate the training based on their ability to startup, based on their ability to sell, based on COOP46 and Project Inspire standards.

However, there is room for this misconception to come to an end. For this action to kick off there is need to have fuel to move the heavy load out of the female world to enhance free minded people with equity in mind, work and decision making. The fuel lies in youth minds. They need to take actions that can impart women and girls with business literacy and entrepreneurship skills.In Malawi, for example, ladies adore men to support them financially. They can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t make decisions because they can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t stand on their own feet to oppose what seems to be oppressive behavior from men.  Women and girls are good at composing songs, performing drama, writing stories and poetry with heart moving messages. That talent can be incorporated with some educative messages into business literacy and entrepreneurship skills to enable women and girls live independent lives. Girls in Africa and Asia are abused because they are not economically empowered. The messages will also teach people the importance of empowering women and girls by helping them to discover themselves from the artistic activities. There are some simple businesses, like selling second-hand clothes, opening up hair dressing salons, baking cakes, just to mention a few of them, which do not require much capital but they bring much benefits._x000D_\nMind you, the modern world needs skilled people in their respective sectors. We need to compose these artistic activities which will turn out into business skills. Be Also, the acting skills imparted to these women and girls will help to enhance their confidence hence carry out their businesses with ease._x000D_\nIn addition, the youths will be conducting training workshops on business literacy and entrepreneurship skills with these women and girls. In turn, these women and girls will have the knowledge to train others within their community. This shall be the determining factor for sustainability.  To strategist this, there is supposed to be cooperatives which will provide easy access to women and girls. If these women and girls are on a cooperative, they can easily access loans and markets. This will see them out of dependent lives to independent ones, free of oppressions. Empowering women and girls economically will also help them to be emotionally, physically and socially stimulated with great heights of innovative minds. We, the youth can and it starts with us.

We will try and explore the issue. _x000D_\nInternet as a public sphere_x000D_\nThe famous sociologist, Jurgen Habermas came up with the following idea of a public sphere._x000D_\nThe public sphere (German \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0093ffentlichkeit, f) is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action.  _x000D_\nThe above definition of a public sphere can very well apply to the Internet, especially social media in its present form. We live in a widely interconnected world. There are more Indians on the internet than ever before. At the last count, there are about 200 million and counting. We live in a world mediated through multifunctional devices and the internet. Internet can be just like a physical public space except that it exists in the virtual realm. Just as the physical space consists of both private space (homes) and a public sphere (a common space which is open to all), Internet also has similar parallels. While personal email can be an example of a private space in the virtual sphere, sites like Twitter, Facebook (to a certain extent), Wikipedia etc. are very similar to public spaces that people access in the physical realm._x000D_\nHowever, the above defined version of public sphere is problematic because it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t take into account the structure that results in exclusion of many groups based on gender, class, caste, religion, sex among others. Nancy Frazer, in her book, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00cb\u009cRethinking the public sphere\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 critiques Habermas\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 idea of public sphere. Frazer elaborated that the public sphere is not egalitarian and its exclusionary structures results in invisibilising many groups that it discriminates against. If we apply this theory against Wikipedia, it brings out striking parallels. Just like women experience harassment in physical public spaces, women also experience harassment in virtual public sphere too. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s a vicious circle. Less number of women on a street, will ensure that the few women that are on the street feel insecure resulting in the further dwindling of numbers. Lesser the number, more the harassment women face on the street. It is essential to break the cycle._x000D_\n _x000D_\nWikipedia is now the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s biggest and most accessed encyclopaedia. It has also become the first go-to website to gain first hand information about any topic. Its wide reach is evident by the fact that an internet search on any topic will have its corresponding Wikipedia article listed in the first ten items on the first page of the search. Not only are people accessing Wikipedia in large numbers, there is also a vibrant community of editors that edit Wikipedia on a regular basis. _x000D_\n _x000D_\nProblem_x000D_\nLack of gender sensitivity in Wikipedia articles needs to be addressed because issues of grave concern viz. issues of domestic violence or sexual assaults lack gender sensitivity and at the same time are accessed by a huge number of people. Case in point is  the Wikipedia entry of unfortunate 2012 gang rape incident. The page was apparently closed down for edits because it experienced rampant vandalism. The details of it all can be found here._x000D_\nNoopur Raval, a Delhi resident and an active Wikipedia volunteer, in this article, shares her experience of editing an article on the Guwahati molestation case._x000D_\nWhile she was working on the Wikipedia article about the Guwahati Molestation Case in 2012, she felt that well-meaning editors saw this article as the publication of a shameful incident and a misrepresentation of the Indian people. She says: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093To write responsibly and acknowledge women's expression \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not a universally obvious and accepted notion and runs into obstacles given the stakes of people involved in women's projects.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d_x000D_\n _x000D_\nOne of the reasons for less number of women editing Wikipedia can be seen in this case, which is a perfect example of vandalism within Wikipedia. Anita Sarkessian, a feminist with an avid interest in gaming found her page vandalised on a regular basis so much so that her page had to be blocked to prevent rogue edits._x000D_\n _x000D_\nSolution_x000D_\nTo address these issues, Breakthrough proposes to undertake the following activities. We plan to organise a series of editathons encouraging more women to come and participate in various capacities as editors of Wikipedia. By doing this, the aim is to have more women participate in creation of open knowledge. The other resulting expectation of this is that this will lead to more women and women-related information being highlighted on Wikipedia. This will also lead to decrease in the invisibilisation of information about women and lead to a larger systemic change of women's role being highlighted more on this widely accessed platform._x000D_\n", "project_details": "Safety and security of women in public spaces is of forefront of Breakthrough\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2s agenda of envisioning a world without violence against women.

The roles most available to women are those of daughter, sister, wife, mother, mother-in-law, etc. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c with few professional careers available. Women are relegated to marginality by the prevailing social, political and economic organization.Woman and girls in particular are disproportionately affected by economic problem. In times of crisis, women tend to stay home with their children, while men more away to look for alternative means of survival. Women also have fewer options to find other ways of making a living especially since women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s literacy rate is not even half of that of men.

The two forms of skills training to be provided in the ELG project are life skills vocational and non-formal skills training, which will take place within the clubs. In addition, the ADCs will host popular recreational activities such as reading, staging dramas, singing, dancing and playing games. The ADC will thus serve as a protected local space in which adolescent girls can meet, socialize, and privately discuss issues of concern with others outside their group and to continue to develop their skills. _x000D_\nThe vocational skills training will comprise a series of courses on income generating activities.

", "sectors": "", "project_summary": "Until the early 1990s, maize trade was of less value in Uganda because quantities available for trade were very low. Besides, quality and standards for Ugandan maize was not valued. Maize production in Uganda has increased from 900,000 to 1,300,000 tones per annum in 2000s. Maize was primarily produced for domestic consumption until regional demand pushed its increased export. Despite these regional & domestic market forces of demand and supply, the structural barriers to market access faced by the smallholder farmer hamper productivity and profitability in the value chain demoralizing farmers at primary areas of production. This causes food insecurity and perpetuates cyclical poverty. At household level, maize contributes nutritional value due to its high content in carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The limited technology to preserve the harvest for future use, lack of awareness from a policy perspective in promoting traditional technologies has also exacerbated food insecurity problems in many parts of the country._x000D_\nThe lack of adequate storage facilities at household or community level, the maize grain cannot be protected and held for future sales. As such farmers accept whatever prices they can get before their produce gets spoilt due to poor storage on farm. This is a contributing factor on rural household poverty and food insecurity. In the months of April, May and June, when the stocks are depleted, any available grain is great in demand. _x000D_\n   _x000D_\nIn-spite of the many interventions made by government and Non-government institutions in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and financing in Uganda has continued to decline. Financing Agriculture in Uganda today requires mitigating two principal risks, 1. Production Risk (the probability that the crop may never be harvested) and 2.
