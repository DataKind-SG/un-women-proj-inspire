It is uncommon to find women in these communities at sea fishing due to the laborious nature of the work involved and the associated risks. Therefore most women resort to hiring men to go out to sea to catch fish for sell on their behalf while others engage in micro businesses like fish mongering,  smoking and frying. Moreover, the number of unemployed women in fishing communities is alarmingly high because they are characterised  by; low levels of education where a few of them complete primary school and fewer transition to secondary school , teenage pregnancy, lack of skills, remoteness, marginalisation from government development initiatives and lack of infrastructure.100 young women living along the shores of Lake Victoria and the nearby islands in Jinja district will be trained on how they can use lake based cages to successfully rear fish for income generation.  The training will equip the women on setting up of fish cages, hatching fish, feeding them, treating them, making fish feeds and joint marketing to achieve economies of scale in the fishing business. The project will set up 10 demonstration cages which will be used by the women to practice fish cage rearing for one cycle, which takes 8 to 12 months for the fish to mature for sale.

Tasks will be guided by their teachers and business mentors who are local entrepreneurs.  The girls will be supported to conduct an individual reflection of the micro businesses they can do from home to find out the businesses they can comfortably do. Using this information, the girls will be supported to form small business teams of 10 girls and come up with business ideas which they will develop further into micro enterprise business plans that integrate ICT usage.

While living in these shelters, they are isolated from their community and do not have access to formal schooling. Consequently, these young women lack the education, skills, and capital to be self-sufficient when they transition back into communities. Without a support network or skills, and facing incredible societal stigma, it is easy for these young women to fall into future abusive relationships or be forced into the sex trade._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAccording to a study by CARE, 30% of Sri Lankans feel that if a girl is raped, she is usually to blame for putting herself into that situation (2013). Societal stigma can make it hard for known survivors of rape to find work, housing, educational opportunities, or even allies. \u201cThey are regarded as \u2018spoiled\u2019 or \u2018damaged goods\u2019 and rejected by family members and peers\u201d (Squire & Wijeratne, 2009). As a result, survivors of sexual abuse are often vulnerable to commercial exploitation. When describing their own reality, survivors use terms like \u201ctrapped,\u201d \u201cheartbroken,\u201d \u201clonely,\u201d and \u201cleft to die.\u201d _x000D_\n_x000D_\nA 2013 UN multi-country cross-sectional study revealed that a shocking 14.6% of men surveyed in Sri Lanka admitted to committing rape. Between 14-34% of college women in Sri Lanka report that they were sexually abused as a child (Perera and \u00d8stbye, 2009). 84% of rape victims in Sri Lanka are under 18 years of age (Women\u2019s Bureau of the Sri Lanka Police Department, 2012) and 97% of abusers are known to their victim (UNICEF, 2012), many of whom are family members and the magnitude of the problem is only growing larger. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Solution:_x000D_\nThe Emerge Beads-to-Business Programme teaches girls business skills using jewellery design as a therapeutic and practical teaching tool. Girls work through a self-paced workbook that tackles concepts such as budgeting, inventory management, product development, marketing, branding, and financing. Throughout the programme, girls create and design their own jewellery, which enables them to generate savings for their futures._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Beads-to-Business Programme is designed around a philosophy Emerge calls Collaborative Capital Creation.  Rather than receiving a hand-out or a loan, girls create jewellery in order to participate in the process of generating their own financial capital while also learning how to leverage this capital. This means that girls have ownership in generating their own capital but do not have to take on the risk of loan repayment, which is challenging for individuals with few support systems.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThrough the Beads-to-Business Programme, girls not only generate capital but also increase their business acumen, leadership skills, and confidence. They build a network of support and mentors, and prepare for their lives as adults equipped with money management knowledge and job readiness. The girls who graduate from the Programme are empowered to improve their lives as well as their communities.  _x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nDesign as a Critical Programme Component:_x000D_\nDesign is the foundation on which girls both heal and learn in the Beads-to-Business Programme.  The process of selecting colours and making choices about patterns and designs enables girls to express themselves and their sense of beauty and have control over a process. The simple act of making choices and beginning to design jewellery supports girls who haven\u2019t had control or ownership over their own bodies, begin to heal. They are dazzled by the colours and shapes, the ways they can fit together, and the options they have in front of them. The process of designing and creating jewellery is meditative. Their world becomes something they can create in one sitting. Something that is beautiful and will help them build a strong future. As one of our participants put it, \u201cbeading frees my mind.\u201d_x000D_\n_x000D_\nJewellery design is also a critical way to teach core business skills. Through the design and creation of jewellery, we introduce concepts such as colours and trends, tools and raw materials, inventory management, product development, quality control, resource utilization, product costing, and more. Jewellery becomes a teaching tool that motivates and inspires the girls to learn. It\u2019s hands-on business education._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe curriculum has four stages: (1) Learn to create jewellery and utilize the \u201cEmerge Store\u201d and \u201cEmerge Bank\u201d (part of a simulation of the economy to help girls learn to budget, save, and make basic transactions); (2) Run the Emerge Store and Emerge Bank, and mentor another participant; (3) Design their own products and plan a jewellery business; (4) Plan a business unrelated to jewellery design to understand how to apply their skills more broadly._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nA Financial Foundation for the Future:_x000D_\nThe girls are allowed to make as much jewellery as they want during the programme. 50% of jewellery sales go directly into a personal savings account of the participant who made the piece, and she is able to access that account once she has turned 18 or has left the shelter.  The remaining 50% of the jewellery sale finances jewellery production materials and shipping/sales costs, to make it a sustainable programme.  Making only 6 products per month, a girl could make ~$500 USD per year, a substantial amount in Sri Lanka._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nDesigning Community Change:_x000D_\nOur curriculum will also support participants to collectively design their own community project.  This project will be sponsored through participants\u2019 Community Fund, which will be composed of a small percentage of the profit of each piece of jewellery sold ($0.25/product).  This project encourages the girls to think critically and collectively about the challenges they have seen in their communities and about an aspect of their community that they would like to change.  By empowering participants to brainstorm, design, budget, and implement their own project, their experience their own capacity as well as the power of working together.  We believe these projects will encourage leadership and make Emerge participants more likely to engage in community building when they leave the shelter._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nDesign as a Way to Promote Awareness:_x000D_\nThe unique jewellery created by the girls has also become an effective avenue to create awareness about an issue that was previously taboo. Jewellery and fashion are approachable; child sexual abuse is not. Each piece of jewellery comes with information about Emerge and the majority of jewellery is sold in Sri Lanka. We currently sell in a number of well-respected boutiques across the country. We also provide kits for individuals who want to sell Emerge jewellery in their home or at craft fairs. These sales have started a terrific conversation and raised awareness about our cause. They have enabled us to increase our network, find opportunities and support for past participants for their reintegration in society, and grab the attention of influential individuals and organizations who can promote policy level changes in the country. Emerge\u2019s distinct designs have been worn by a number of Colombo socialites, as well as former Miss Sri Lanka.  What was once an extremely taboo issue is now one that is being talked about by mainstream media regularly._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nGeographic Coverage:_x000D_\nEmerge programme participants are from all parts of Sri Lanka and are placed in shelters based on their court dates and shelter availability. Therefore, Emerge programming reaches girls who will take their knowledge back to communities across the country. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nRipple Effect:_x000D_\nThe impact of $25,000 will extend far beyond the young women immediately impacted, into their communities.  Past participants report that they after leaving Emerge they are a critical source of knowledge on financial matters in their family, business leaders in their communities, and that they aim to serve all girls who have survived abuse to help them heal and rebuild their lives.  At Emerge, we invest in strong girls, girls who we know will rock the boat and fight for a better future.  Emerge often works with girls who have survived abuse in their own families, and have has the courage to come forward, speak out in court, to work to protect their younger sister and to create a safe reality for their own children.  What if these courageous and resilient young women had the skills, resources and networks to enact their own visions of change? At Emerge, we believe these are the best investments we can make.

While I'm proud of the progress I've achieved on my own through bootstrapping, I'm currently at an inflection point.  I can see clearly into the future to what ResSpot can become but I\u2019m presently too cash-strapped to build a world-class, fully functional portal. The quotes I\u2019ve received from South African digital agencies come to around R120,000 ($10,000 USD). However, ResSpot requires a technical partner and not a once-off agency, as the platform will undergo various iterations and improvements as it is tested in the market. Thus my plan is to invest $15,000 on hiring a full-time technical partner who will not only build a world-class ResSpot portal but also perform the day-to-day maintenance and upgrades required to keep it competitive and user responsive. Approximately, $4,000 will go toward hiring a young and bright female intern who I will train to be my \u2018right hand woman\u2019 and function as the business development lead for the business.

When available, these collectors sell excess collected wild mushrooms for some income to improve their poor economic status. Mushrooms are Non-Timber Forest Products which have high nutritional and/or medicinal properties. The Mushroom Unit of CSIR-Food Research Institute in Ghana has conducted some studies on mushroom biodiversity assessment, domestication trials and nutritional content determination. Mushrooms can be cultivated on various agro-industrial wastes such as sawdust, rice straw, plantain leaves, and wastes from roots and tuber crops (cassava, cocoyam and yam peels), among others.With these results, some farmers, entrepreneurs and youth have been trained to cultivate domesticated mushrooms for income and improved nutrition and health while minimizing environmental pollution caused by improper disposal of agro-industrial wastes including sawdust and cassava and yam peels. Most of these trained people are producing mushrooms in Accra and its neighbouring towns. These activities have not extended to forest fringe rural communities in Ghana where there is high rate of poverty, malnourishment and related socio-economic problems, although they generate large quantities of agro-industrial wastes._x000D_\nThis project will seek to improve the livelihoods of women and girls in forest fringe rural communities through establishing them to be at the fore-front of the mushroom industry in their communities in the following ways;_x000D_\n1.\tTraining in mushroom cultivation_x000D_\n2.\tProviding start-up mushroom production and preservation facilities_x000D_\n3.\tDeveloping market-linkages for sale of packaged mushrooms_x000D_\n4.\tTraining on production of dried spent mushroom compost blocks for use as fuel to replace firewood_x000D_\nTwo hundred (200) promising women and girls (40 each from 5 forest fringe communities in 5 regions in rural Ghana) will be economically empowered by building their capacity to be at the fore front of the mushroom business in the respective communities._x000D_\nTraining workshops will be organized for these women and girls. Through these training workshops, knowledge and skills in mushroom cultivation will be impacted to these women and girls. They will also be taught about good practices in mushroom cultivation, as well as appropriate harvesting and storage methods. These workshops will be very practical to ensure that the appropriate skills are transferred to these women and girls. Pictorial hand-outs and fliers will be used in these training workshops. _x000D_\nMushroom production requires facilities including a composting platform, bagging shed, sterilization unit, and an incubation room and cropping house, both of which should have shelves to accommodate mushroom compost bags. These facilities contribute immensely to the start-up cost of the mushroom business.

The platform will also have a roof and fence to avoid leaching of the agro-industrial waste being composted by the heavy downpour in those areas as well as avoid disturbances from ruminants and fowls which may be in the neighbourhood. The bagging shed will be half the size of the composting platform and will also be roofed. The sterilization unit will be designed to be fuelled by firewood at the initial stage of the project. However, the firewood will be replaced with the dried spent compost blocks after the first. Both the incubation room and cropping house will be designed to have the capacity to accommodate 5000 compost bags at a goal. _x000D_\nThe facilities will be handed over to the trained women and girls who show the ability to practice the skills gained and manage the resources given to them.

One group will be responsible for producing mushroom compost bags, the second group will be responsible for producing good quality fresh mushrooms, the third group will be responsible for drying, packaging and marketing the mushrooms, while the fourth group in each community will be responsible for drying and marketing dried spent mushroom compost blocks for firewood to maximize the mushroom production value chain. _x000D_\nMost mushrooms are highly perishable, having a shelf life of 2 days when kept at room temperature without the administration of any preservation methods.

This would mean that these bags have to be discarded. However, it is known that these bags can be put to further use. It is also known that most households in these communities use either charcoal or firewood as fuel for cooking. In this project, the fourth group in each community will be taught how to effectively dry the spent compost bags for use as fuel.

Since the women in sex trade are trafficked at a very young age, they are illiterate and do not realize the importance of education. This contributes to the prevalence of the vicious cycle of intergenerational prostitution amongst the daughters of women in sex trade. Since education serves as a main weapon to fight second generation prostitution, it features as an integral aspect in the services provided to AAWC beneficiaries. Further, basic education is also used as one of the tools for empowerment of the women in brothel-based prostitution._x000D_\n_x000D_\nCurrent AAWC Services and Need Statement:_x000D_\nWhile AAWC provides educational opportunities for both Umeed and Udaan beneficiaries through school enrollment, after-school tuition, Adult Literacy Program and basic computer class; the quality of educational material provided could be improved significantly through the use of technology as an engaging mode. The Adult Literacy Program for the Umeed women is conducted in brothels with no current use of technology. Also, there are no fixed or regularly scheduled computer literacy courses available for the girls. This proves a hindrance in the continuation of computer literacy education. Further, most Udaan beneficiaries attend government-run schools, which lack the motivation to provide informative syllabus and dedicated teachers.

We find that most of the girls who we educate in schools stop studying at this age to marry and don`t seem to reap the benefits of education in terms of continuing their study or seeking employment. Since Nepal has poor economic conditions and unemployment is rife even among boys (and more so post-earthquake) families of these girls see no alternative to marriage.

Menstrual Cups represent a re-usable, affordable, sanitary, and discreet form of Menstrual Health Management (MHM): odorless, stain and leak free, as well as being far more environmentally sustainable than disposable sanitary napkins. Furthermore, they go beyond the fundamental level of economic empowerment (education); they enforce a gender-equity based message that school is just as much for girls as it is for boys. It allows girls equal access to school attendance as boys by providing them with the tools to manage their menstruation safely and without shame or harassment. Menstrual Cups show girls that just because their bodies are more stigmatized than boys\u2019, does not mean that they must be limited and punished for it. The long-term effects of educated girls are innumerable, and assuring their ability to attend school without limits is the first step towards true economic empowerment._x000D_\nUsing 3D printing technology, we will produce and distribute Menstrual Cups (MCs) to girls attending school in Zimbabwe.

Girls are often subject to cruelty from their peers due to staining, odors, leaks or stigmas surrounding menstruation. They also often lack proper sanitary equipment and menstruation-related knowledge and can suffer from infection, discomfort or even unplanned pregnancy as a result.

But this is being practiced in some limited areas. About 96 % population of Madhubani districts lives in rural areas of villages. Our aim is to make the painting and other art forms of Madhubani district as income source and base of livelihood. And, not only painting, there are other weaving and knitting techniques, which are being practiced by the women and girls of Madhubani that can be taken out as base of livelihood for them. Apart from this, several other techniques with the help of wood, bamboo, grass, waste plastic bags or other wastes like bottles is being used in making decorative arts that can be taken to national and international level market to make them employable and self reliant.With the help of technology, several workshops on wall paintings, decorative arts, printing techniques can be organized, in case the experts are not available locally.

This greatly damages opportunity for business development, entrepreneurship and social mobility more generally. _x000D_\nSome financial faith in traditional cottage industries, such as silk rearing and weaving would go a long way towards rebuilding these communities that live under the shadow of conflict and poverty. Our khadi and silk weavers in Assam have been creating beautiful, sustainable fabrics for generations. They create peace silk, which doesn\u2019t kill the silk worm or moth as part of the process. They create khadi, a sustainable cotton that is the symbol of Indian independence. Their fabrics are naturally organic and the workshops operate in a co-op style fashion, with in-built community support systems. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nOver the past 18 months, we have implemented demonstrable financial traction and substantial social impact in Lakwa.

We are seeking funding in order to start small and smart, by expanding to two new villages in Assam - one in the Sivsagar cluster where we currently work, and another in the Bodoland Territorial Council Districts. Both of these communities are conflict-affected weaving villages, with workshops run by and for women. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nBy replicating our participatory, technology driven approach, we can generate income for women in these new communities. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWe will spend the $25,000 to:_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1. Bring two new villages into The Fabric Social community of weavers. This will involve relationship building, consultation and training.

Our communities should feel they have ownership over The Fabric Social as equal participants. They work for themselves, not for us. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n2. Purchase second hand iPhones and iPads, so that we can implement our app. The Fabric Social app is developed by the CodeCloud education platform, who uses us as an example project for their aspiring software engineers to practice their skills. This is a longitudinal aspect of our project, developed over time and in close consultation with our weavers. This will allow for the women to track their production, track their income, keep on top of quality control and to communicate with us at any time. It is vital to the sustainability of this project, which works with geographically and socially isolated communities. It also eliminates the risk of funds pooling with one person or one set of people, and ensures transparency in workloads and payment. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n3. Establish SHGs (self-help groups) in the new villages. The National Rural Livelihood Mission program supports women\u2019s groups who have proven that they can save funding together as a group. This can be as little as 100 rupees per week over six months, which is then matched by the Indian government. Pooling community funding shows commitment to the group as a whole and can allow for future planning of larger purchases, such as dyeing equipment, bicycles, loom construction and weaving training. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n4. Purchase and distribute solar lamps and chargers from Illumination Solar, to overcome electricity scarcity. We have built a relationship with Illumination, who donated 20 lamps to our pilot project. The lamps mean that the weavers can work at any time of their choosing. It has the added benefit of reducing the hazardous use of kerosene lamps in the home, of allowing children to do homework at night and providing added security when moving around the village in the dark. The solar chargers mean that the women can continue using the smartphone app, even without electricity. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n5. Invest in commissioning new clothing designs, and in advertising these to the Australian market. This involves prototype development, product development, fabric testing, stress testing and dye development. Each new village will have different skill sets and strengths to which the project should be tailored. We never tell our weavers what they should do, we work with existing talent on the ground. This means our fabrics and designs will not always work in every village, and that product development starts afresh in new contexts. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n6.

Sindh is the province of Pakistan which has two mega ports and its biggest cities like Karachi and Hyderabad are the industrialized cities where most of the women laborers are engaged in working in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods and cotton. Motor industries and the Bangle markets are the famous places where the informal bangle industry is flexing its muscles in this area.

Due to poverty and inflation the number of home-based women workers is increasing. Through the ages women support their families by stitching and sewing .In present scenario, women are involved in other form of works like the carpet making and bangles. Their earning is so small that it would be hard to run a home by their own. The biggest impact of this situation is that women and men are in severe debts.

Instead of that, they are trapping in kidney problems and severe backache .If anybody in their home would be severely ill, they are not able to treat him or her in any hospital either government or private.

Currently the tribe\u2019s vast abac\u00e1 fiber production brings very little economic and socio-cultural opportunity to women, leaving them less productive and economically disempowered The Higaonon people are socially inclined, have a strong sense of community, and enjoy favourable conditions for growing abac\u00e1, making them well suited to take on the challenge of social enterprise.  _x000D_\nIt is in this context that a group of PeaceMovers of Move This World-Philippines proposes a year-long program that aims to provide economic and socio-cultural opportunity for Higaonon women and girls by using solar-powered equipment to process raw abac\u00e1 fiber into Higaonon-inspired handicrafts. Believing that pairing Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) with design training and access to simple technology will awaken the inherent strengths of the Higaonon people in a sustainable way, the project will include two congruent phases.  The first phase is six months of empathy-based programming on resilience, team building, diversity appreciation, conflict resolution, and cultural preservation anchored in Move This World\u2019s evidence-based curriculum.

India is headed towards a digital revolution, this intervention builds on this concept and shall stress on use of mobile and internet not just for communication but for the overall empowerment of women. RLEK will capacitate women belonging to traditional forest dwelling communities, Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes, minorities through capacity building initiatives in the arena of digital literacy.  It would train women to use mobile technology to protect and promote their rights and entitlements. This would involve trainings on e-governance (submission of forms online, printing requisite information etc.), e-banking, e-reservations, e-retail and shopping etc. Trainings will also be imparted to women Self-Help Group members to further entrepreneurship development as they will be facilitated to use digital tools to establish market linkages, promote sales of their products etc. The project will be befitting model which uses Information and communication technology to help the most marginalized groups to take up entrepreneurship development and business literacy. \u201cIt is/will be a journey from Jungle Age to Digital Age\u201d. This whole process will enable a bottom up approach to the overall development of marginalised women who lack access to basic rights such as health, education, decision making.  _x000D_\nThe traditional forest dwelling women community i.e. the Van Gujjar women live deep in the forests, away from human habitations and are normally cut off from any roads or telecommunication facilities. They face a vicious cycle of lack of - infrastructure, development and policy implementation. The \u2018digital divide\u2019 is worst for them as they are poor, have low levels of literacy and live in remote forest areas. ICT is a tool for communication and interaction for some but for the Van Gujjars, it has been used as a weapon to bring social change and a revolution in their lives. The \u2018digital divide\u2019 negates economic and social opportunity for them. The process of equipping the Van Gujjars with wireless handsets was witnessed at the time when the communication revolution had not unfolded and the digital age had not set in. With no landlines, mobiles or any other connectivity means as these communities live deep in the forests these wireless handsets opened a range of opportunities for them. The use of information technology by these communities not just served as a means to communicate but also helped them in maintaining the ecology, addressing health emergencies, gender inclusion and providing the communities a voice in the system which was earlier absent. It has also helped the community in asserting their rights over the forest and empowering them in the real sense. Their familiarity with the use of wireless technology has made it easy for them to easily adapt to the use of mobile phones. It is from this stage that the present project will be taken up thereby digitally empowering these groups to further their rights and entitlements through the use of communication technology._x000D_\n", "country_impact": "IN", "project_details_other": "Women face gender disparity, problem is even grimmer with women from Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe, traditional forest dwelling communities, embroiled in the vicious circle of poverty, illiteracy, lack of decision making etc. When it comes to digital literacy this disparity is even starker.

As other countries of central Africa, Rwanda constitutes of different communities with different cultures and different living conditions. A community of indigenous people currently known as historically marginalized people (HMP) is the one and the most disadvantaged group with a lot of marginalization, stigmatization and violations committed on them. They were living in the tropical forests and in some volcanoes and hills (Rwanda). Since the years of 1977 up to 1995 they were evicted from the forests in order to establish national parks. But unfortunately the integration policy of the government was not successful and failed because indigenous people of Rwanda known as Batwa (ethnic name) or historically marginalized people continued to face a lot of marginalization and violations from their neighbors other communities for example; children in schools, women in villages, men in public works, this affected them to feel inferior and no confident in the whole life. The women from the community of historically marginalized people are the most victims of violations and marginalization. Rwanda has promoted gender equality and empowered a woman in every aspect of lives but unfortunately HMP/Batwa women are still facing many violations of their rights including domestic violations. In enabling this idea/project, we have initiated to train HMP women in different corners of the country. The training is on gender basic violence, woman violence in general, human rights especially women rights and self advocacy. After a 6 days session of training, the trainees will go to train their fellow\u2019s women and their partners\u2019 men. Gender basic violence is a serious issue in sub-Sahara African countries including Rwanda but most particularly in the communities of indigenous people of Rwanda currently known as historically marginalized people, so women trainees are to go to train other women not only in HMPs families but also in other communities in order to increase their confidence too!.

This activity will last one (1) month._x000D_\nActivity 2:Training:  50 women (girls) trained trainers are to be collected at the same place (hotel) for a 6 days training session. Main training concepts are gender issues among family members, trust between man and woman, role of woman (historically marginalized woman) in community development and country in whole, human rights especially indigenous rights. Other discursive concepts are relationship between HMP and other communities, malnutrition issues (how to prepare a complete meal) and so on\u2026. This activity mixed with a mid-reporting will last 1 month. _x000D_\nActivity 3: community based training: 50 women trained are to go in different corners of the country in their communities and neighbors to disseminate what they have acquired from the training.

When asked why, answers range from lack of money (to purchase PCs or other web-enabled devices or pay for training) to no time or lack of parental consent. However, there was 94% acknowledgement of ICT application importance and 87% with high expectations for ICT/Entrepreneurship training opportunities among the young people. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nQualitative data gathered in a focus group discussion more recently revealed that women and girls especially face even deeper barriers than their male counterparts in accessing and using the technology.  High costs, socio-cultural biases (such as women\u2019s role in family life or male dominance and supremacy), and access to education and knowledge seem to be the underlying critical factors. In one of our focus group discussions also conducted in Ajegunle community of Lagos Nigeria, February 2015 involving 23 women between the ages of 30 and 50, only 3 of the women use the internet to one degree or other - and only one of them uses it regularly for social interaction and for staying informed. The other 2 of the 3 who use the web go after it only when they need information. Four of the women own smartphones and only one of them owns a desktop computer. Over half of the group struggled to comprehend the meaning of such words as 'the internet,' 'the web' or 'browsing.' This would seem very strange because Lagos is the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, with a teeming population estimated at about 12 million. Yet, in one of the most popular and most populous slums in Nigeria, majority of the women go about their struggle for survival, completely cut off technology and the web._x000D_\nThese trends were amplified while analyzing data from another focus group discussion involving much younger women; ages 18 to 30. The girls were drawn from various underserved communities in Lagos, Nigeria. While some of them already use the technology to one degree or other, they identified cost of access (to devices and the web) as the main constraint to access and use of web-enabled technologies. Fewer still understood the benefits of web-enabled ICTs, and even less had the skills required to access, integrate, evaluate, or create online information. Worse still, 8 of 15 girls had experienced harassment and bullying online, but none of the victims had either reported this to anyone or confronted the perpetrator(s). When asked the reason for this \u2018silence,\u2019 silence filled the room. In many African cultures, girls are raised to be subservient and accepting. They are not expected to \u2018raise\u2019 their voice or be heard. This \u2018culture of silence\u2019 by itself is responsible for the perpetuation of many forms of discrimination against and abuse of women and girls._x000D_\n_x000D_\nUnder-served communities, such as Ajegunle, account for majority of unemployed, derelict and abused women and girls; many of them who are involved in precarious lifestyles involving vulnerable sexual relations, substance abuse, prostitution, teenage and unwanted pregnancy, and other vices whose negative impact on the society are high. Focusing on combating poverty and unemployment, with attention on girls in underserved areas is very deliberate. Empowerment for women and girls is a pressing need. Sixty percent of the 100 million school age children in the developing world are girls who grow up without access to basic education.1 Globally, women\u2019s chances to benefit from the advantages of the information society are one third less than men\u2019s.1 According to Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI)\u2019s Affordability Report 2014, '\u2026while Internet penetration rates have increased dramatically in recent years, the pace of change seems to be slowing.'2 The report particularly identified that women belong with certain groups that are far less likely to be able to connect to the Internet affordably. There is research evidence to suggest that there are greater possibilities for women\u2019s socio-economic empowerment through web-enabled ICTs. The aim of the project will be to use ICTs and other relevant skills training as an enabler for empowerment. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nAccess to technology and training is a basic requirement for girls\u2019 participation in the global information economy. GET \u2018A\u2019 L.I.F.E project aims to address the barriers young women especially face by providing digital literacy and digital rights literacy training for girls. The program will cover such topics courses as Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentation Programs & Databases, Design Tools,  Internet & World Wide Web (Introducing them to safety and security on the web), social media tools, securing online work, Business Planning, Enterprise Management, Leadership, Communication, Time Management, Team Work, Social Responsibility and financial literacy among others. A careful selection process will ensure that the training admits only those who need such intervention the most, have a high level of interest in learning and who would be available for training throughout the duration of the project. All training will be delivered by qualified instructors and/or professionals. The trainees will be provided with continued post-program mentorship and support for a period of six months after graduation. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe training will take place in a conducive training facility complete with audio-visual training aid over a period of seven weeks. There would be four sessions (of seven weeks training) in the year 2016; each session admitting a minimum of 25 girls in order make a total of 100 girls trained after the four sessions.

Sadly, women lack importantly the bargaining power and decision-making, whether it be in reproductive health, family income and access to resources. In male-chauvinistic socio-cultural setting, systems and customs at different levels  impose restrictions  on  many women  by sidelining  them from mainstream development. Women basically require her rights to work, earn and generate income which is often the way she is forced by circumstances to struggle._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn another perspective, women lack access to quick sources of loans or credit facilities from established financial institutions such as the Banks for meeting their livelihood requirements.

He believed that his fundamental works were sufficiently advanced to propose a more acceptable galenical form than raw egg cures. _x000D_\nIn 1978,  studies of Doctor Truffier incorporated 10 years' experience and observations on patients having followed detailed protocol and strict rules in terms of dosage, clinical and biological surveillance. _x000D_\nTwo studies of vital significance were also to aid this development.\u2028_x000D_\nFirstly, that of Lineweaver, who was to reveal a new fraction of albumen, identified by the name 'ovomucoid'._x000D_\nA Franco-Belgian scientific team led by Doctor Bruttmann, an expert allergist at the French Ministry of Health, carried out a double blind clinical study versus placebo with 33 allergists; this study confirmed surprising results observed by Truffier (La M\u00e9decine Biologique, April 1995)._x000D_\nIn 1971, Dr Liu discovered that white of quail's eggs contained enzyme inhibitors other than ovomucoid: ovoinhibitors, glycoproteins which are also natural de-inhibitors of serine proteases and have a powerful effect on trypsin._x000D_\nIn 1990, Canadian study was to show that the ovomucoid in quail eggs had a powerful activity on elastase that acts in a large number of human pathologies._x000D_\nIn 1994, Dr Takahashi showed that, out of all avian species, the ovomucoid of quail egg whites was the only one capable of inhibiting human trypsin._x000D_\nThe works of Dr Bruttmann (CHU de Grenoble, 2007) Rapport Vergnaud-2007-activite-trypsine-elastase-humaine - on the stability of ovomucoid and its inhibiting effect on trypsins and the works of Dr Sainte-Laudy, Effect of ovomucoide on human basophile activation were to follow, which added to many scientific publications._x000D_\nNowadays, anti-allergy properties of quail eggs are being studied in several major universities and high-level research centres. Constant progress in biotechnology has given us a clearer understanding of mechanisms involved in action of quail eggs and of their outstanding properties, and has scientifically confirmed remarkable clinical results observed in the past among several thousand people suffering from allergic symptoms._x000D_\nAn average egg weighs approximately 20 g; the calorie content of an egg is 30.6 calories (Kcal). 100 g of quail eggs therefore contain 153 calories (Kcal). Quail eggs are a choice food as they have an excellent nutritional value. Their nutritional input per 100 g is 13 g of protein, 11 g of fat and 0.5 g of carbohydrates. As the eggs are low in carbohydrates, they have no glycaemic load (GL = 0). Their high protein content and zero GL therefore mean that they are suitable for inclusion in hyper-protein diets. Quail eggs also have a low cholesterol input (0.8 mg/100 g), which means that they may be recommended for low cholesterol diets._x000D_\nRaising quail is fun, interesting and profitable. Quail raising is not expensive, provides very healthy low-fat white meat, and supplies the fertilizer you need for your home garden. Quails are easy to raise and housing required is not as complicated as for chickens. A large number of birds can thus be raised in a very small space. You can raise 6 to 7 quails in the same place that is required for one chicken. The birds do not easily contract fowl diseases common to poultry, especially chickens. So risks are less. Vaccination is not needed and the drugs usually given to chickens do not have to be added. Quails grow very fast and gain maturity faster than any other poultry birds._x000D_\nIn Benin people don\u2019t know much about quail eggs. 90% of the population of Benin are illiterate. In the villages there are no electrisity. This means that newspapers, flyers, internet and TV are not available for most of the people. The only possible TECHNOLOGY of marketing in far villages is a radio. By our project we are going to explain on rural radio how quail egg is useful.  Marketing TECHNOLOGY also provides by distribution of 2,000  flyers in citys. The DESIGN of flyers  will include a table containing recommendations on use of this eggs._x000D_\n  Then we are going to train women in quail egg production. The training will apply the TECHNOLOGY of quail egg production described in 2002 by Doctor of Agricultural Sciences Afanasev Grigory. We are also going to supply women of all that needed to start this business. For purification TECHNOLOGY  of cages we will instole easily removable tray. It will allowd to use bird droppings as a garden bio fertilizer. Since our NGO fighting for environmental protection we are going to use very special TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN of packaging. The quail egg packaging will be braided with straw. Plastic packaging pollute. For production of cardboard pallets trees are destroyed. The straw basketare always availible and decomposes rapidly.Their price is twice cheaper than for plastic ones. From the other side it will give more work for braiders. For eggs are not to be broken, we are going to place several rods as diameters, so the eggs will not tuch each other._x000D_\n It is a very promising project. As quail eggs are smaller in size, so the price is also lower than other bird\u2019s egg, all types of people can buy this eggs and you can easily sell it.  If you raise 100 layers with 70% egg production there will be 70 eggs a day. The birds will consume 2 kg of feeds a day; say 300 FCFA . If the eggs are sold at 25 FCFA each, there will be 1,750 FCFA from daily sales, this means 1,450 FCFA profit daily. Multiply this by twice or thrice the number of layers.

In most regions, there are no daily newspapers and, except for foreign radio stations such as the BBC, Radio Azadi, and Voice of America, there exists only an Afghan government-affiliated TV station and several small FM stations that offer only music broadcasts and limited daily news.  Religious and cultural barriers restrict most women from leaving their homes, and illiteracy prevents most women from accessing print or on-line media. Violence and extremism further prevent women from gaining access to education and jobs and participating in socio-economic activities. The lack of educated people in human rights in the media leaves local religious extremists to fill the vacuum\u2014to spread propaganda that insists on an extremely limited and subordinate role for women in society.

The National Development Plan (NDP II) Strategy of Uganda that focuses toward \u201cincreasing household income and promoting equity\u201d recognizes agriculture as a primary source of growth in Uganda. The Strategy seeks to assess this objective by measuring changes in agricultural production and productivity; among other things. At policy level, agriculture is at the center of the national development agenda. There is general consensus that agriculture can and does play a significant role in raising household incomes, providing employment and contributing to overall economic growth. The Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and Investment Plan 2010/11-2014/15 of the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries of Uganda also targets to improve household food and nutrition security.  The West Nile Community-Based Agriculture Improvement project will be implemented by Abi Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute (ZARDI) among grass-root farming communities \u2013 targeting women groups \u2013 in the North Western region of Uganda (commonly called West Nile Region). Whereas Abi ZARDI serves the entire West Nile region of Uganda consisting of eight districts, the project will focus its activities in grass-root communities located in the three districts of Adjumani, Nebbi and Yumbe. These are communities where the per capita consumption is quite low, way below the internationally accepted USD 1.25 a day. Over 80% of the community members depend on agriculture for their livelihood yet crop yields in these areas are low (only about 30% of the potential yield of improved varieties). Key factors contributing to this low yield include, use of poor quality seed that are low-yielding and less-tolerant to diseases; use of bad agricultural practices that deteriorate soil health; lack of access to proper extension services and information for better agricultural production. In these communities, about 23.2% of the population has never attained any level of formal education, with women forming the greatest percentage (17.8%); hence the level of poverty is much higher than the national average (24.5%). _x000D_\nIn each of the selected districts, two sub counties will be identified in a participatory manner, involving all key stakeholders. A key consideration to be made while identifying groups is that all members should be women and/or girls. Each group should consist of 30 members who have at least an acre (2.5 ha) of land for the group\u2019s joint learning activities and seed multiplication. Besides the group farmers field, each member of a group will be required to have at least half an acre of an individual field for personal/family agricultural production purposes. In the group fields, farmer field schools and demonstrations will be conducted by Abi ZARDI technical staff in a participatory manner so as to enable the participating farmers to learn by doing; and later employ the same recommended practices in their individual fields. _x000D_\nFarmer capacity building will be done in the areas of agronomy, soil and water conservation, soil fertility improvement, pest and disease management, post-harvest handling, among others. Key topics to be taught will include, but not limited to, seed identification and variety characteristic, seedbed preparation, planting methods and seed rates, plant spacing, and pest and disease control. Trainings will also be conducted on topics such as record keeping, marketing, credits, loans and savings. Abi ZARDI has the required technical capacity to undertake the training through the competent staff in the various disciplines. The group fields will be located close to major community roads so that other non participating members of the community can be able to learn by seeing. A farmer institutional development process will be conducted to each identified group to ensure that issues such as constituting an executive, visioning, group dynamics and cohesion, among others, are handled at the onset of the project. _x000D_\nThe model crops selected in this project are cassava, groundnuts, rice and improve mangoes due to their importance in the farming system and current demands from farmers. The significance and specific attributes of the selected seed include the following:_x000D_\nCassava (NASE 14): Cassava is number one food and cash crop grown in the West Nile region by every household. NASE 14 variety has been adapted both on-farm and on-station and both scientists and farmers have noted that that it is sweet, produces bigger and straight tubers, and most important of all, it is tolerant Cassava Brown Streak disease, the current severe cassava disease in Uganda. _x000D_\nRice (NERICA 4): Rice is the crop commodity that has recently won the interest of many farmers in Uganda due to its attractive market value. In 2014, the total land area cultivated under rice in West Nile region alone was 1,073.3 ha. Amongst other upland varieties, NERICA 4 is the most adapted upland rice variety in the West Nile region, where the most dominant rice cultivation ecology is rain-fed upland. Special attributes associated with it are high yielding (3-4 t/ha), early maturing (110 days), resistance to rice blast and other cereal diseases, tolerant to drought and has good eating quality. _x000D_\nGroundnuts (Serenut 4): Groundnut is the second most important food legume in Uganda. It is a good source of protein and oil in the diet of both urban and rural populations. The current on-farm production of groundnuts in West Nile region is however low because about 75% of farmers are growing local land races that are susceptible to rosette disease resulting into low yields. However, Serenut 4 is early maturing (80-100 days), tolerant to most common groundnut diseases, has a high yield (2.5 t/ha) and it is sweet and soft and thus most preferred by farmers._x000D_\nGrafted Mangoes (Kate and Alphonso): In light of promoting sustainable income generation from perennial crops, the government of Uganda is promoting fruit (citrus and mango) production as strategic commodity for the northern and eastern parts of Uganda. This comes along with the indirect benefit of environmental conservation especially through fixing larger quantities of atmospheric carbon (a greenhouse gas) in long term perennial crops. Amongst other mango varieties tested by Abi ZARDI in West Nile region, Kate and Alphonso varieties have adapted well to the West Nile agro-ecological zone and have been preferred by farmers due to their sweet taste, high yield, tolerance to pests and diseases and the attractive market preference. The stated attributes were established by both farmers and scientists and if when promoted are more likely to improve adoption rates, productivity, food security and household incomes. _x000D_\nFor quality assurance purposes, Abi ZARDI will obtain breeders and foundation of improved seeds of identified crop varieties from National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in case of cassava and rice, while groundnuts will be obtained from National semi-Arid Crops Resources Research Institute (NaSARRI) \u2013 research institutes under the National Agricultural Research Organization. Seedlings of the identified mango varieties will be raised locally from within the Institute. An assessment of the bio-physical characteristics of farmer group locations and other relevant needs assessments will be conducted prior to settling on the kind of crop commodity to be allocated for production by each women farmer group. This will be done in order to ensure maximum adoption and returns \u2013 in terms of yield performance and income \u2013 from the crop commodity allocated to the groups. The participating farmers will be encouraged to bulk and sell their surplus seeds to other indirectly participating farmers, local NGOs and the public.

Globalization, environmental degradation, and high levels of poverty are currently severely impacting the indigenous women (Dayak) of Borneo. Historically women weaved products every day with motifs and techniques found nowhere else in the world. Currently, globalization, decreased capacity, and environmental degradation are destroying indigenous rights and culture in West Borneo. We have partnered with a weaving cooperative (which our team members also helped found) that provides training for 1500 dayak women in the Sintang district of West Borneo. Currently, these women are showing decreased quality in their products as they no longer have access to natural dyes. This decreased quality not only causes a decrease in the value (e.g. negative economic impacts) but also causes women to use chemical dyes straying away from their traditional practices. For example, on average an active weaver may produce up to 8 large products a year using chemical dyes yielding a total income of around USD$560. However, using natural dyes, on average, the product\u2019s value will increase by 35-50%. This means that on average a women could increase her yearly income from weaving from around $500 to close to USD $$750. These numbers demonstrate the importance of natural dyes from a purely economic perspective. On a philosophical platform natural dyes more closely preserve the weavers\u2019 customs, cultures, and represent the strong connection that the indigenous people of Borneo once had with the forest. Currently, younger women have expressed they no longer know the techniques needed to create natural dyes. To combat this our team will create recipe books that explain various ingredients and processes needed to produce a desired color. Moreover, although this weaving cooperative grew from just 5 weavers to now over 1500 it currently services only one district and one tribe. Therefore, we have developed an integrated multidisciplinary approach to empower women, increase local capacity, and preserve indigenous culture.For the women in the weaving cooperative we plan to: (i) build an international website to help them sell their products, (ii) provide training in marketing strategies and business techniques, (iii) develop community gardens on degraded lands to increase access to natural dyes, and (iv) create a small book that provides a 'recipe' for women to create a natural dye. Are use of modern technology will help identify new ways for women to obtain natural dyes. Our workshops will resemble mini-chemistry labs were we try different recipes and techniques to achieve the colors desired. Moreover, we will provide marketing training for the cooperative women to help leverage their ability to sell products internationally. For this grant these objectives can be achieved._x000D_\nOur long term goal is to replicate our already successful model in the capital city of West Kalimantan (Pontianak). This cooperative will serve as the home of the 'West Kalimantan Craft Network.' This network will not only target women in the Sintang district but throughout the entire region. Coordinating with different ethnic groups and tribes, this center will act as a place of knowledge, sharing, buying and selling. Visitors and tourists can directly purchase their products, but most importantly, women from rural villages can participate in training programs, workshops, and meet other artisans throughout the region to learn how to preserve their local material culture but also contribute to their household financials situation. We believe this integrated approach provides a strong economic incentive for women to engage in the preservation of their local culture.  There are a few other organizations around the world that have used a similar model, however, they are for-profit. They often force artisans to create products that are popular with buyers, giving the artisans specific colors, techniques, and sizes of products. As a non-profit organization we believe this approach only negatively impacts indigenous rights. We put the artisans and the women first. We have no requirements for products made, rather we value each women's technique, motifs, and methods used. We do provide training and act as a facilitator connecting older generation weavers and artisans with younger women. The underlying objectives of our approach support indigenous women's rights, cultural preservation, as well as economic development. The fusion of these field and this multidisciplinary approach creates a revolving system where women are connected, empowered, and preserving their local tribes culture and art work. Together, through innovation, we can create harmony on our planet.  _x000D_\n", "country_impact": "ID", "project_details_other": "Currently, due to the expansion of urban centers, globalization, and lack of development local indigenous communities in West Kalimantan are facing many hardships. From the expansion of various cultures, many local communities are losing their traditional techniques causing their history and cultural background to become at risk for extinction. Due to a degraded ecosystem, many products have declined in quality as producers have decreased access to forest products that they use for natural dyes and product creation.

Ethiopia is among one of the east African country with the highest population size. Most of the population in Ethiopia is young about 50% of them women.  Though the size of women in Ethiopia among the population is high or similar to that of male they are not contributing as it is expected. Most of the women left behind because of multiple issues impacted on them. Despite the fact that the government of Ethiopia trying to benefit women still it is not enough to brought them and presenting in front of public as a role model as influential person, this may be due to different visible and invisible factors which could be simple but overlooked to the government. As a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Ethiopia pledged to pursue a series of benchmark and targets relating to gender equality. The targets aim to empower women and eliminate gender disparity in all levels of education by 2015. (1) _x000D_\n Most of the population in Ethiopia resides in rural area. Starting from birth, an Ethiopian female in most families is of lower status and commands little respect relative to her brothers and male counterparts. As soon as she is able, she starts caring for younger siblings, helps in food preparation, and spends long hours hauling firewood and fetching water. As she grows older, she is valued for the role she will play in establishing kinship bonds through marriage to another family, thereby strengthening the community status of her family. She is taught to be subservient, as a disobedient daughter is an embarrassment to her family. Low status characterizes virtually every aspect of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s lives. Given the heavy workload imposed on girls at an early age, early marriage without choice, and a subservient role to both husband and mother-in-law, girls and women are left with few opportunities to make and act on their own decisions.( 2). This all are the challenges of female in Ethiopia. After all those confront some extra ordinary female will attain to the place they want by defending the family and the community negative values and perception in posed on her. Finally with all challenge they may attend higher institution and still the challenges may continue sexual harassment and violence from student, staff. The economic status is also considered among the main challenges of female student. In the university with all the challenges mentioned above she may get a better academic score and have got the chance to join to the university as academic staff after the graduation. The maximum chance she got after she get into the higher institution as academic staff is joining masters program. And after the completion of the master degree she becomes stable. No trust in women\u2019s capacity to achieve the maximum level expected like that of the male._x000D_\nThe intention of the project will be how could we improve the competence of those female academic staff by putting simple supportive effort and ultimately how could we use the knowledge, the skill of those few women with great potential even with those big challenge they had faced.

Though the issue of the undergraduate female student is considered a little bit, there is huge gap toward improving the academic rank of the female staff in the higher institution of Ethiopian university. Higher education female staff becomes stable after they have got their masters degree. Women have multiple reasons for this specific case there are multiple burdens on her. She will thought about social issue like marriage, nature,(pregnancy,birth,child caring) no network for any updated information then she becomes stable._x000D_\n _x000D_\nAccording to the NICHE project reports by Dr.Anouka van Eerdewijk and Franz Wong assessment of female faculty and leadership, among PhD holder academic staff on duty male 93% and female 7% and PhD holder academic staff on leave accounts male 94% and 6% female in 2014 in Ethiopia higher institution respectively. 5% of the leadership positions are occupied by women. All presidents and VPs are male. Gender balance in leadership positions is not higher at levels of colleges or departments. About 7% of decision making place (Senate member) were occupied by women and 11% of the members of Academic Commissions are women.( 4,5) Yet, for all degrees, the share of female faculty is far below the target of 20% for 2014/2015._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn leadership position as it is observed the percentage is really incredible. Could we say that we are living, computing with the world imagine the entire figure why our contribution is less. Is that because female has no knowledge and skills to do things? Even Ethiopian Ministry of Education has no clear strategy to encourage the female academic staff in higher institution. Even though the figure of female academic staff is very small they were not supported yet to get them to higher level education which is PhD they became sable after they do their masters degree. This may be due to different factors. Female academic staff has different role-stressors level than male academic staff. Women in Ethiopia had faced a lot of challenge. The intention to leave the university is higher among the female academic staff than in the male staff.(6)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nEthiopian women wishing to follow a university education must overcome significant social and educational disadvantages. Women in Ethiopia face lots of challenges starting from lower grade to the higher education not only that their challenges will go to the future which is un-endless. They come from different cultures where they have grown in the environment which was said you can\u2019t, no-body is appreciating the women for her multiple duties in the home. Women from rural areas in particularly do not have the confidence to assert or defend themselves. In addition their schooling can be interrupted or curtailed for a variety of reasons including: families not seeing the education of women as important; schools being long distances from home; schools without toilet facilities; and girls working in the home. Despite of the problems that the women face few of them may reach better place by defeating the challenges but still we need to consider her effort with simple support we can build their capacity. When we see one of the Ethiopian higher institution strategies which is increasing the participation of women in research activities but sill the strategy lucks what activities to do in order to encourage and increase their participation.

In Pakistan only a short percentage of women are involved in politics, business & jobs mostly in developed cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan & Faisalabad. Majority of women in small cities don\u2019t have opportunity of equality in jobs, salaries, politics & business. Mansehra is one of the developing city of Pakistan where women are mostly discouraged to involve in business & politics due to cultural constraints. Literate women/girls move for jobs but there is no concept of private business for women in District Mansehra. Literate women/girls get income by jobs but illiterate women/girls remain dependent of male (father, brother, husband). Some times in their lives due to this dependency they face huge troubles of fulfilling their basic needs. They depends on others even for buying food, clothes, vegetable, transportation, health cure & education. Women living in Mansehra don\u2019t have any idea about kitchen budget management & home budget management which causes extra expenditure & they face problem to get their basic needs.. In such situations they suffer too much by missing basic needs of lives. To over come the problem there is intense need to involve those women/girls in small business. If they come to practical field they can generate income by themselves & fulfill their basic needs. _x000D_\nProposed Solution_x000D_\nKeeping in view the critical situation of women living in Mansehra we can establish a training resource/display center in Mansehra. To create opportunity for women/girls of Mansehra in income generation & business development this resource center will play important role. In this resource/display center women from whole city & surrounding areas will come for getting trainings of embroidery, sewing, cutting, candle making, making baby products, honey bee farming & kitchen gardening. As this resource/display center will also be used to sell/display products prepared in training center during & after completing trainings of women/girls, they will also get practical training of selling products, customer handling & marketing products. Beside this they will be trained about home/kitchen budget management which will affect their home budgets. By this training they will plan home budgets & prioritize their basic needs & extra expense will be controlled. In this way they will be able to get theoretical as well as practical training of preparing products & selling them to customers. Beside this the display center will produce enough income to meet the expenses of training center as well as display center including, salaries, fare, utilities, raw material & transportation etc. In this resource center job opportunities will also create for sale girls, counter girls & administration. They will also get jobs in this center & be able to get enough money for their own expenses. After a reasonable time period they will be able to start their own display/training centers in different locations of the District which will cause sustainable women empowerment._x000D_\nTo establishing training/display center following activities will be done,_x000D_\n1.\tIdentification of place for training/display center._x000D_\nFirst of all a central suitable location will be identified for establishing training/display center with reasonable security & monthly rent. Place will be identified by keeping in view the access of women, customers & suppliers._x000D_\n2.\tEstablishment of training/display center._x000D_\nIn this phase after hiring a reasonable place for training/display center, center will be renovated, decorated & equipped with all necessary equipment & furniture. Training equipments, furniture for students, trainers, training equipment, IT equipments will be procured & arranged in center. 1 Desktop computer, 1 CCTV camera, 1 multimedia, 1 software & students chairs/tables, white board etc will be procured for training center._x000D_\n3.\tHiring of Master Trainers._x000D_\nAfter establishing the training center master trainers for sewing, cutting, embroidery, candle making, kitchen gardening, honey bee farming & making baby products will be hired to train the women/girls. 3 master trainers will be hired, one will be heading the training center (also involved in trainings) while 2 others will fully involve in training as well as display center. These trainers will be full time employees of training/display center & will be engaged in trainings in center & selling products in display center. Women trainees interested to get job in display center they will be hired as sale girls, receptionist, and administration. The salaries of those women/girls will be managed by selling products in display center._x000D_\n4.\tProcurement of raw material, products for training/display center._x000D_\nTo fully equip the training/display center raw material for training, training equipments & finished products will be procured for training center. In raw material, cloths, needles, thread, buttons, decoration material, candle making material, honey bee farming material will be purchased. This raw material will be purchased in batches as per need of training for women/girls students._x000D_\n5.\tConducting trainings._x000D_\nSeveral kind of trainings will be conducted in the training center e.g cutting, sewing, embroidery, candle making, honey bee farming, and kitchen gardening & making baby products (local). These trainings will be conducted by keeping in view interest of students as well as need of students. Women having land will get training of kitchen gardening & women having resources of sewing, cutting & embroidery will get same kind of training. These women students will also get training of selling products, handling customers & buying products from the market. This will enable them to start their own small businesses.

This awareness will be raised by news papers, radio messages, displaying banners, wall chalking, by advertising on local TV cable. In this way more women will come to join trainings, more customers will visit display center, selling of products will increase, women will get more work & more income which will encourage them to work hard & get more income._x000D_\n7.\tCertification ceremony. _x000D_\nAfter getting complete trainings from the center, they will get a training certificate after passing through a process of proper examinations under supervision of Districts Social Welfare Department. In 1st batch 180 women will get certificate on completion of training. Two certification Ceremonies will be organized to issue certificates in 360 women. By getting the certificate they will be able to get jobs in different institutes as well as they will be more confidents to start their own businesses with their available resources._x000D_\nSustainability_x000D_\nGetting knowledge is benefit for whole life, training is by itself a sustainable programme which can benefit the trainee throughout whole life period. In this programme we will provide them theoretical as well as practical trainings of preparing products, selling products, handling customers, handling suppliers, buying raw material. Beside this display center will be utilized to display all products prepared by women during trainings & after trainings. In this display center they could easily sell their products & be able to get a reasonable income after completing their trainings.

With recent research highlighting the impact of gender inequalities on development, there has been a compelling move toward investing in programs that increase women\u2019s economic participation with policies and interventions aimed at promoting women\u2019s economic empowerment. The economic empowerment of women has been linked to: poverty reduction especially in low-income households facilitates the achievement of other important public policy goals such as economic growth, improved human development, and reduced violence.  In recent times it has become widely accepted that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are key cornerstones in achieving development results._x000D_\nBackground (literature review)_x000D_\nThe concept of empowering women through measures to increase social, economic and political participation has gained momentum over the past three decades.  The promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women is recognized as a key step in addressing extreme poverty as noted in the Millenium Development Goals (MDG\u2019s).  It is noted that the economic participation of women is important not only to lower the levels of poverty among women, but is also a crucial step in encouraging economic development in countries as a whole.  There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that education, employment and ownership rights of women have a powerful influence on their ability to control their environment and contribute to economic development.  The World Bank describes gender equality as smart economics, noting that the integration of women in well functioning markets as both consumers and producers is linked to economic development, growth and greater welfare. (World Development Report 2012)_x000D_\nWomen\u2019s economic empowerment is defined as the capacity for women to participate in, contribute to and benefit from growth processes in ways that recognize the value of their contribution, respect their dignity and make it possible to negotiate a fairer distribution of the benefits of growth (Eyben et al., 2008).  Tornqvist and Schmitz define it as the process which increases women\u2019s real power over economic decisions that influence their lives and priorities in society.  It can be achieved through equal access to and control over critical economic resources and opportunities and the elimination of structural gender inequalities in the labour market including a better sharing of unpaid care work (Tornqvist and Schmitz 2009 p.9).  The economic empowerment of women is central to the achievement of gender equality and the implementation of international commitments (OECD, 2012).  UN Women considers that women\u2019s economic empowerment is essential for any strategy of poverty alleviation and defines this as \u2018having access to and control over the means to make a living on a sustainable and long term basis, and receiving the material benefits of this access and control\u2019 (Carr, 2000; Mosedale, 2005)_x000D_\nA world bank report noted that the unequal education and employment opportunities for women in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) is estimated to have retarded annual per capita growth by 0.8 percentage points between 1960 and 1992, this is crucial because a boost of 0.8 percentage points per year would have doubled economic growth, the study further suggests that gender inequality appears to account for about 15-20% of the growth performance between SSA and East Asia.  Gender equality may not be the main cause of poverty in Africa but it is a key element in accounting for the regions poor economic performance.  An OECD report (2012) highlights that when more women work, economies grow; an increase in female labour force participation results in faster economic growth.  Blackden et al also note that much of the economic activity in Africa is in the hands of women especially in Agriculture and informal business, creating opportunities for women can help to not only empower them but also to unlock the full economic potential for their nations._x000D_\nCanagarajah et al highlight the fact that when provided with the opportunity women are able to participate and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction citing the example of Uganda between 1992 and 1996 where women\u2019s participation in the rural non farm sector increased as such raising the income of women and of households headed by them (Gender and economic growth in Uganda p.30)_x000D_\nJohn Ward et al in their research find critical evidence that greater gender equality in the developing world could enhance economic growth, the evidence links improving gender equality to key factors of economic growth by expanding the stock of human capital, raising labour productivity, improving agricultural productivity and increasing stock of physical capital._x000D_\nNetsaye underscores the fact that despite the great strides achieved in empowering women, gender inequality continues to be a major challenge in Africa.  It is prevalent in all sectors of the economy including the labour market.  This is despite the fact that women contribute immensely to the labour market, training and education. (Gender and economic empowerment in Africa: evidence and policy p.88).  She highlights the various initiatives undertaken at the regional level with the aim of achieving women\u2019s empowerment such as:  the African Union protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa adopted in 2005 to protect women\u2019s economic and social rights, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) which proposes to reduce gender disparities on the African continent and the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo which also called for women\u2019s empowerment; this coupled with the various legislations and policies adopted at the country level still the issue of gender equality and empowerment is yet to be fully integrated into policy formulation with gender gaps still existing between men and women in economic opportunities(p.89)_x000D_\nHobson notes that women dominate the informal sector that plays a huge role in SSA economies (Hobson 2011).  The informal sector employs 72% of the non agricultural employment in SSA and 48% in North Africa (Dejene, 2007). In Kenya during the last decade, the growth rate in the sector\u2019s employment has remained above that of the formal sector, which declined over the same period. The informal sector has seen its share in total employment rise from 16% in 1980, to 63.6% in 1997 and 70% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2001, employment in the sector rose by 11.4%. Its share in GDP has also recorded increases, rising from 13% in 1993 to 18% in 1999 (Republic of Kenya, 2002). Sectorally, the informal sector is the second largest source of employment after small-scale agriculture  According to the ILO in SSA 84% of women are informally employed compared to 63% of men; women in Africa are predominantly work in agricultural sector involved in subsistence farming.  FAO estimates that 60% of employed women in SSA women work in agriculture and play a big role in food security in the region.  In Kenya 75% of women live in the rural area and are involved in floriculture, growing of tea and coffee, vegetables and cereals (ILO, 2004).  It is however noted that there are still gender gaps that exist hindering women\u2019s economic participation.  These gaps inflict costs on the society in terms of lost agricultural output, food security and economic growth.  Women in this sector face numerous challenges, with evidence showing that constraints to land ownership, lack of access to inputs by women are key impediments to increasing agricultural output and economic growth.  _x000D_\nA striking phenomenon of recent times is the extent to which women\u2019s participation in the labour force has increased. This increased participation has been driving employment trends and the gender gaps in labour force participation rates have been shrinking.  A majority of women in SSA are engaged in Micro and Small enterprises (MSE\u2019s), in Kenya 49% of women nationally are engaged in MSE\u2019s nationally, in the rural areas they account for 55.8% of women working in MSE\u2019s.  Women are often engaged in work that is considered female such as food processing, dressmaking and tailoring.  Their involvement in the informal business sector is a vital contribution to poverty reduction, wealth creation and employment (UN Women, 2011).  However mainstream government economic policies and trade agreements often neglect these women.  Women in this sector often find it difficult to access credit due to lack collateral; a factor that limits the scale of their operations.

It is for the ordinary people. It is to take the social progress to a new height. I dream that the world will be a lovely and fair place someday. And the people would enjoy it with full vigor and economic security._x000D_\nTo make the world a fair place, and achieve the economic security for the ordinary people I have always searched for a right socio-economic order and now I\u2019ve developed a new kind of business model that can ensure parity among the people in the society, and therefore, nations which didn\u2019t attain prosperity yet, can get the opportunity to build them up using this model. _x000D_\nWhy I am thinking of a model to do business in a new way? And why I am calling it Social Business?_x000D_\nI am thinking of a new way to do business to give the world economic order a new shape. The present one is mostly dominated by a few business groups of the world. Actually they are captivating the world to make policy in favor of them. The roots of the conflict among the people of the society and the countries at large lie here. _x000D_\nThis scenario is common in the poor and developing countries. You can see few dishonest people are grabbing public resources in the name of business, becoming elected members in the parliament and making policy to save them. They even swallow the last savings of the public that they deposit in the banks and invest in the capital market to reap small benefit. These people are not interested to pay taxes too. So the businesses they do are not supportive to the further development of the society._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOn the contrary, you know, global wealth inequality is very hopeless. I want to put a \u2018very\u2019 before hopeless.  Imagine, the top 1% people own 41% wealth of the world.  Top 10% own 86% of the wealth. And bottom half just own 1% of the wealth of the world! So billions of people are living a very hard life where as the number of billionaires (who own more than $1 billion or more) are increasing every year. The number of billionaires has reached at 2325 in 2014 after 7% increase in the last year. This is happening due to present system of business. The present concepts of business groups give ownership to their inner circle - to a few people._x000D_\nInequality was not so severe in the nineteenth century as that time industrial revolution was just taking place. In spite of that Karl Mark wanted to change the economic order of the world. He gave his judgment in favor to the labors than capital. Lenin made a way to make it happened the idea as Leninism. As a result, we found a new type of state owned business \u2013 a new economic order. _x000D_\nThis socialist model of business has collapsed with the fall of Soviet Union. Virtually, the socialism is dead now. There are two major reasons behind the fall of socialism. First, it produced a lethargic administration controlled by the central government. Second, the system could not accommodate the human creativity and freedom of choice. Beyond that limitation, it had great impact on the capitalist system._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAgain, redistribution of resources to many has been urgent but that will not happen in a way like socialism. So, the emergence of a new kind of business is urgent, where ordinary people can participate with their small capital, even who don\u2019t have any, can be involved in business and can get profit of the business to live a meaningful and enjoyable life. Thus many people of the society will have access to the meaningful economic activities._x000D_\nThis type of business will be joint enterprises by the ordinary people. It will have commitment to be honest and to sincere to their society. It will be transparent and tax payers. It will create social funds for the society and the government that needs in time. It will act as social platform, on which people of the society will have right to access to get their personal benefit, and to monitor and guide it. So, it is better to call this type of business as social business, because ordinary social people are doing business for the benefit of themselves and for the society as well. Thus, it will create one type of social ownership, contribute to increase the social capital, and finally serve the democratic environment._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDefinition: A social business is a joint venture by a maximum number of people who are agreed to share the maximum profit among its associate partners and for social causes with the aim to do honest business and redistribution of resources to many so that poverty gap can be reduced, understanding among the people of the society (social capital) can be increased, government can get maximum taxes to build up the country and ultimately the world can be a fair place. (In short)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nClarification of the idea_x000D_\n_x000D_\nA social business is a joint venture_x000D_\nA social business will be a joint entrepreneurship of a group of common people. The number of participants will depend on the volume and nature of business and the number will increase simultaneously with the expansion of the business. This is to achieve the ultimate objective of a social business \u2013 the redistribution of resource to many \u2013 so that capital cannot be concentrate to a few people. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nInclusion of associate partner_x000D_\nInclusion of associate partner is an important feature of social business. It is for the people who do not have money but can contribute their labour or expertise and become owner of a business. Types and number of associate partner will vary based on the nature and volume of the business._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA social business is a profitable entity_x000D_\nIn my view, all the business should be profitable entities unless it is charity business. I have proposed to pay major share of profit (min. 50%) to its associate partners and the wellbeing of society._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA social business is an honest business and tax payer_x000D_\nA social business must be socially transparent. Therefore, all the information it must be kept open to the public through web portal regularly. Transparency is more than a word. It will be the way of doing social business. A social business have to create such an option so that anybody (may be a citizen group, organization, law enforcement authority, etc.) can monitor it if needed or they wish to see whether it is involved any criminal activities or that is harmful for the society. This policy is adapted, because social business must hate the creation of black money. On the contrary, it is believed in the model that an honest Tax Paying society is essential to build up a developed nation. It must not hide the profit or cannot show any unforeseen expenditure to reduce the taxes. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nNo access to capital market_x000D_\nA social business cannot be enlisted in capital market never at no time. One of the objectives of the social business is to eliminate the capital market from the world; because it gives birth of a bubble economy. It swallows the money of the ordinary people most of the time. So we have to find out a new type of capital market (if needed). We have to stop to sale a $10 bond/share of a company, which can pay $2-3 profit a year (say) cannot be sold at $100 or more._x000D_\n_x000D_\nCreation of social fund_x000D_\nA social business will create different types of social fund that can contribute to the society and the government enormously. As for example, it is seen that during natural calamities government invites rich people to donate money. This is not a noble practice. Rather, the social business groups believe that the society/government would have the right to use these social funds in times as a social business (other business too) does business and makes profit from the society._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA social business is a social platform_x000D_\nA social business is a Social Platform because it always thinks to do the betterment of the society and its people within its capacity. Anybody wish can be involved by investing money or without any investment time to time to his personal gain. Anybody can be involved in a social business to raise fund for any social cause. A social business must expend a certain % of the profit for the development of the locality where it operates, therefore, a social business would be a socially and environment-friendly entity. A social business will always work to create new social businesses.

We came to know about the Flourishing bilingual nursery and primary school because of the presence of our Food and Technology Division in Douala. That is our unit of food transformation and conservation for sales. We have collaborated previously with the Upper Room Christian Fellowship Douala, which is behind this school project, and our interest in helping the construction of the school lies in the fact that our presence in Douala has helped bring in people from the English speaking part of Cameroon who settled in this suburb area of Bonaberi.  The school was created as a response to the urgent, pushing and unfulfilled need of hundreds of children living in Ndobo \u2013 Bonaberi. Douala is the economic capital of Cameroon with more than 2.000.000 people, and as all thickly populated towns, it has attracted many persons from the other regions of Cameroon, who came looking for a better opportunity in life. It is a French speaking Region of Cameroon. We are now on the third generation of that immigration even from the English speaking part of Cameroon. These immigrants from other parts of Cameroon have settled in the suburbs because of less cost. Some of these areas are becoming ghettos and not served with facilities like schools, hospitals, public offices.... Children have been travelling for far distances to attend a nursery and a primary school, making it a huge problem for the parents\u2019 pockets, for the physical health of the children and even for their security.  Children are reported missing and even involved in road accidents every day. The today\u2019s parents are more conscious of the wellbeing of their children and have been the drive for the creating of the Flourishing Bilingual Nursery and Primary school. The school is ran in a rented wooden structure, without any sanitary facility, without any security and not even sufficient for the children. (pictures included) The school is ran by a set of professionals with a Christian background, who came together to render a quality service at a very moderate price for the parents. The quality of the education is very good, meanwhile the quality of the structure and what it offers is very poor. There is not enough space, the building is not quite accessible during the rainy seasons and there are no sanitary facilities. There is a big opportunity to provide a better facility for these children who are so many, given the fact that the land has already been acquired in that area and the school is already registered. The project aims to provide a low cost but solid structure for the English and French speaking children, that is, 2 nursery school classes French and English, 6 primary school classes French and English, making it 16 classes all together. A staff room has been foreseen so as to facilitate communication and work sharing between the teachers. This is because our experience for the past year has shown us that the exchange between staff members is very important for the proper running of the school. A multipurpose hall has also been foreseen so as to encourage recreational moments between the children, moments for devotion, or simply moments of sharing between the children. Water facilities have also been foreseen. It is difficult to find a water system toilet in our local schools, but we deem it very necessary to keep up the sanitary standards of the school, teaching and helping the children to been clean at their early ages. Many children in Cameroon die at an early age because of lack of good sanitary conditions. We did not forget an open playing space for the children of about 900 square metres. HELP ME I HELP YOU is a no profit organization which has been by the side of the Flourishing Bilingual School from the beginning, giving a helping hand with the updating training to the teachers involved. The school is autonomous and ran by a group of Christian qualified teachers headed by a professional with experience in the teaching field. The school will accept up to 40 children per class. Presently the school is running 2 in 1 classes because of lack of space. For example class one and two are in the same class. Class three and four are in the same class and so on. HELP ME I HELP YOU and the Flourishing Bilingual School are both contributing in kind and in cash for the success of this project. Even the Mayor of Douala 5, who rules Bonaberi, has given his accord for the provision of a better structure for the children of the suburb, and part of the funds will be demanded from the Douala 5 Council. The general community of Ndobo has appreciated very much the fact that the school offers teaching for both French and English speaking children. (please see the proposed plan of the school).

Ranging from insults to physical assault, street harassment has become one of the most common and noticeable methods of discouraging women from publicly participating in society. There have been several incidents of throwing acid on women's faces in Kabul, Herat, Juzjan and Qunduz. All these methods of harassment lead to loss of women's motivation to work and study.   A commonly-used Afghan proverb brutally says: 'A women's place is either her husband's house or her grave.' This common belief contributes not only to the street harassment of women, but also to the violence and abuse women face in families, schools, universities and workplaces.    _x000D_\nHowever, as opposed to many other countries, in Afghanistan, street harassment is not recognized as a problem and a system to support and assist survivors of assault is non-existent. Members of the Afghan National Police often engage in harassment of women and, despite the fact that insulting women is considered a crime by the Law against Violence against Women, the issue of street harassment is not specifically identified or addressed._x000D_\nIndividual women have developed their own methods to fight street harassment. To deny the satisfaction of accomplishment to the violators, many women adopt a silent attitude towards the harassment they face. The silent treatment is a common way women choose to protect themselves and discourage the person who verbally abuses them. Another way of dealing with this problem has been initiation of the harassment by the women when they say something condescending to men, in order to prevent their harassment and to prove that they are not afraid of men's presence. Some women have verbal fights, or mini-fist-fights that usually end with the interference of an outsider._x000D_\nThese methods can be efficient in stopping a few cases of harassment. However, to efficiently stop street harassment, there needs to be a coordinated public movement against it.  Thus YOUTH will target boys specifically from high school and newly entrants to university by conducting baseline survey regarding their thoughts to street harassment, based on the research we will conduct trainings for both boys and girls on how to fight against street harassment. _x000D_\nTo better introduce the issue for public people YOUTH will arrange dialogues among boys and effected girls through media so they could better express their speeches to concern government authorities on the issues. _x000D_\nFinally for long impact of the project YOUTH will establish friendly using website on which users can register their names both as person who is effected of street harassment and the person who could better provide advice on the mentioned issues.

Unlike the harassment other demographics face (e.g. racial harassment, homophobic harassment, disability harassment), the street harassment of girls/women because of their gender is usually not taken seriously and few other groups address it. It\u2019s seen as a joke, compliment, or their fault. In reality, street harassment limits women\u2019s peace of mind and mobility, making it a gender equality and human rights issue.

If they want do some income generation activity , they have no capital. Due to poor condition, the banks also do not provide credit. The major cause for such a situation is that all the women in the villages are primarily dependent upon their husband/father and on rain fed agriculture for their sustenance. There is no irrigation facility in villages of Sivanmalai  block of Tirupur District of Tamil Nadu . 60% women and girls are illiterate. The agriculture has now become uncertain because of climate change & untimely rainfall. This ultimately leads them to sit idle or to migrate to distant places in search of livelihoods as labor or maid servant, where they get further exploited.

The high schools are only 3 to 4 in number in a block (amongst 200 to 300 villages) and situated about 3 to 5 kilometers from the village near block-headquarter or near market area. High school education is costly because of costlier books and some fee in the school. Poor parents hence do not send their girls to high school.  There are also no public transport in the villages nor are pitch roads. Hence parents do not allow their daughters to go far on foot due to fear of rape and bad law & order situation. Till they pass 5th, they become adolescent and married thereafter by the age of 14-16 years. The major cause for this is lack of money and a narrow attitude of parents towards girls.
